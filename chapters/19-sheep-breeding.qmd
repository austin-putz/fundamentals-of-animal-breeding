# Sheep Breeding {#sec-sheep-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter provides an overview of sheep breeding with emphasis on wool, meat, and dual-purpose breeds.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe breed types and their distinct breeding objectives
2. Identify key traits and genetic parameters in sheep
3. Explain the role of terminal sire crossbreeding in lamb production
4. Understand genetic evaluation systems (LAMBPLAN, NSIP)
5. Recognize challenges unique to sheep breeding

## Breed Types and Objectives

- **Wool breeds**: Merino (fine wool production)
- **Meat breeds**: Suffolk, Hampshire, Dorset (terminal sires)
- **Dual-purpose breeds**: Polypay, Columbia, Targhee
- **Hair sheep**: Katahdin, Dorper

## Key Traits and Heritabilities

### Growth Traits

- Birth weight: h² = 0.25-0.45
- Weaning weight: h² = 0.25-0.45

### Reproduction

- Litter size: h² = 0.10-0.15

### Wool Traits

- Fleece weight: h² = 0.30-0.60
- Fiber diameter: h² = 0.30-0.60

## Genetic Evaluation

- LAMBPLAN (Australia)
- NSIP (US)

## Crossbreeding Systems

Terminal sire × maternal breed ewes

## Summary

Sheep breeding objectives vary widely (wool, meat, dual-purpose). Terminal sire crossbreeding is widely used in meat production.
