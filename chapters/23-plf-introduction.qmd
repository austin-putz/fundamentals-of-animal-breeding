1. Define precision livestock farming and its objectives
2. Identify major PLF technologies and their applications
3. Explain how PLF enables high-throughput phenotyping for breeding
4. Understand data management challenges with PLF
5. Recognize opportunities for PLF to accelerate genetic improvement

## What is Precision Livestock Farming (PLF)?

::: {.callout-note}
## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development.

**Definition**: Using sensors, automation, and data analytics to monitor and manage individual animals

**Objectives**:
- Improve animal welfare
- Increase productivity
- Enhance efficiency
- Promote sustainability

## PLF Technologies Overview

### Sensors

- Wearables (collars, ear tags, leg bands)
- Cameras (2D, 3D, thermal)
- Microphones
- Environmental sensors
- Feeding systems

### Data Collection

- Continuous, automated, high-resolution
- Massive datasets requiring careful management

### Data Analytics

- Machine learning
- Computer vision
- Predictive models

## PLF for Phenotyping in Animal Breeding

### Advantages

- **High-throughput phenotyping**: Measure thousands of animals automatically
- **New traits**: Traits difficult or expensive to measure traditionally
  - Individual feed intake
  - Activity and behavior
  - Health indicators
- **Precision**: Reduced measurement error
- **Longitudinal data**: Repeated measurements over time

## Key Application Areas

1. **Feed efficiency**: Individual feed intake (RFI, FCR)
2. **Health monitoring**: Early disease detection, lameness, mastitis
3. **Reproduction**: Estrus detection, calving/farrowing monitoring
4. **Behavior and welfare**: Activity, lying time, social interactions
5. **Growth and body composition**: Automated weighing, 3D imaging
6. **Environmental impact**: Methane emissions, nitrogen excretion

## Data Management Challenges

- **Volume**: Massive datasets (terabytes per farm)
- **Quality control**: Sensor errors, missing data, outliers
- **Integration**: Linking sensor data with pedigree and genomic data
- **Privacy and security**: Data ownership, sharing, security

## PLF and Genetic Improvement

PLF enables:

- Selection for hard-to-measure traits (feed efficiency, methane, health)
- Increased accuracy of genetic evaluations (more data per animal)
- Identifying new traits (resilience, robustness, stress response)
- Genotype-by-environment interactions

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Challenges

- Cost of sensors and infrastructure
- Validation of sensor data accuracy
- Farmer adoption and training
- Integration with breeding programs

### Opportunities

- Accelerate genetic improvement
- Novel phenotypes for selection
- Improved animal welfare monitoring

## Summary

Precision livestock farming enables automated, high-throughput phenotyping that can accelerate genetic improvement.

## Key Points

- PLF technologies generate vast amounts of data requiring careful management
- PLF enables genetic selection for traits previously too expensive to measure
- Integration of PLF data with breeding programs is an active research area
