# Camelidae Breeding {#sec-camelidae-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter introduces breeding of alpacas, llamas, and camels as emerging livestock species.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the main camelidae species and their uses
2. Identify key traits for alpaca fiber production
3. Understand the challenges of breeding in small, closed populations
4. Recognize opportunities for applying modern breeding methods

## Camelidae Species Overview

::: {.callout-note}
## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development.
:::

- **Alpacas** (Vicugna pacos): Fiber production
- **Llamas** (Lama glama): Pack animals, fiber, guard animals
- **Camels**: Dromedary and Bactrian

## Alpaca Breeding

### Primary Objective

Fiber quality and quantity

### Key Traits

- Fiber fineness (micron): h² = 0.30-0.60
- Fleece weight: h² = 0.30-0.60
- Fiber length: h² = 0.30-0.60

## Llama Breeding

Objectives: Temperament, size, conformation

## Camel Breeding

Objectives: Milk production, meat, racing, fiber

## Challenges and Opportunities

- Small populations (especially alpacas outside South America)
- Limited phenotypic data and genetic research
- Inbreeding risk in closed populations
- Opportunity for genomic tools to accelerate progress

## Summary

Camelidae breeding is less developed than traditional livestock. Small population sizes create genetic diversity challenges.
