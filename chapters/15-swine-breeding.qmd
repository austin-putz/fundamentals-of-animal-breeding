# Swine Breeding {#sec-swine-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of commercial swine breeding programs, traits, and industry structure.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the three-tier swine breeding structure
2. Explain the distinction between terminal and maternal breeding objectives
3. Identify key traits and their genetic parameters in swine
4. Design a crossbreeding program for commercial swine production
5. Understand the role of genomic selection in modern swine breeding

## Global Swine Industry Structure

::: {.callout-note}
## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development. Content will cover:

- Major breeding companies (Genus/PIC, Topigs Norsvin, Genesus, etc.)
- Three-tier breeding pyramid (nucleus, multiplier, commercial)
- Pure lines vs. crossbreds
- Global genetics flow and regional adaptation

## Key Traits and Heritabilities

### Maternal Traits

- Litter size (TNB, NBA, NW): h² = 0.10-0.15
- Piglet survival
- Weaning weight
- Maternal ability

### Growth Traits

- Average daily gain (ADG): h² = 0.30-0.50
- Backfat depth: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Loin depth: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Feed efficiency (RFI): h² = 0.30-0.50

### Meat Quality

- pH: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Color: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Marbling: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Drip loss: h² = 0.20-0.40

## Crossbreeding Systems

Content to be developed covering:

- Terminal sire lines (Duroc, Pietrain, synthetic lines)
- Maternal lines (Large White, Landrace)
- F₁ females in commercial production
- Rotational systems for maintaining heterosis

## Selection Indices

Content to be developed covering:

- Terminal sire index
- Maternal index
- Economic weights and derivation

## Genomic Selection in Swine

Content to be developed covering:

- Implementation timeline
- Genomic tools (PorcineSNP60, GeneSeek GGP-Porcine)
- Impact on accuracy and generation interval

## Summary

This chapter introduced the commercial swine breeding industry, emphasizing the distinction between terminal and maternal breeding objectives and the role of genomic selection in modern swine improvement.

## Key Points

- Swine breeding is highly structured with distinct maternal and terminal lines
- Crossbreeding exploits heterosis for reproductive traits
- Genomic selection has accelerated genetic progress
- Economic weights differ dramatically between maternal and terminal objectives
