# Dairy Cattle Breeding {#sec-dairy-cattle-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter provides a deep dive into dairy cattle breeding, focusing on the transition to genomic selection.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the structure of the dairy breeding industry
2. Explain how genomic selection transformed dairy cattle breeding
3. Identify key traits and genetic parameters in dairy cattle
4. Interpret selection indices (Net Merit, Cheese Merit)
5. Understand antagonistic genetic correlations affecting breeding objectives

## Global Dairy Industry Structure

## Key Traits and Heritabilities

### Production Traits

- Milk yield: h² = 0.25-0.40
- Fat yield: h² = 0.25-0.40
- Protein yield: h² = 0.25-0.40

### Fertility and Reproduction

- Daughter pregnancy rate: h² = 0.05-0.10
- Calving ease: h² = 0.05-0.10

### Health Traits

- Mastitis resistance: h² = 0.05-0.15
- Lameness: h² = 0.05-0.15

## Genetic Correlations

- Milk yield vs. fertility: r_A ≈ -0.3 to -0.4 (antagonistic)
- Milk yield vs. health: r_A ≈ -0.2 to -0.3 (antagonistic)

## Selection Indices

Content to be developed covering:

- Net Merit (NM$)
- Cheese Merit (CM$)
- Fluid Merit (FM$)

## Genomic Selection Revolution

Content to be developed covering:

- Implementation timeline (~2009 in US)
- Doubled rate of genetic gain
- Reduced generation interval from 6-7 years to 2-3 years

## Summary

Dairy cattle breeding was revolutionized by genomic selection, which increased accuracy while reducing generation interval.

## Key Points

- Genomic selection increased accuracy while reducing generation interval
- Balancing production with fertility and health is critical
- Economic indices guide selection decisions
