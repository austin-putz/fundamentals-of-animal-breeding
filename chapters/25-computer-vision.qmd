## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development.

**Definition**: Using cameras and image analysis to extract phenotypic information

**Advantages**:
- Non-invasive
- High-throughput
- Automated

**Types of Cameras**:
- 2D cameras (RGB)
- 3D cameras (depth sensors, stereo cameras, LiDAR)
- Thermal cameras

## 2D Image Analysis

### Applications

1. **Body condition scoring (BCS)**: Automated scoring using images of animals
2. **Activity and behavior**: Posture classification, social interactions
3. **Lameness detection**: Gait analysis from video
4. **Identification**: Facial recognition, coat pattern identification

### Computer Vision Techniques

- Object detection (locate animals in images)
- Image segmentation (separate animal from background)
- Feature extraction (body shape, posture)
- Deep learning (convolutional neural networks)

### Commercial Systems

- DeLaval body condition scoring
- Cainthus (behavior monitoring)

## 3D Imaging and Depth Sensors

### Technologies

- Time-of-flight cameras
- Structured light
- Stereo vision
- LiDAR

### Applications

1. **Body weight estimation**: 3D body volume correlates with weight
2. **Body composition**: Estimate muscle and fat distribution
3. **Growth monitoring**: Automated weight tracking without handling animals
4. **Conformation traits**: Measure body dimensions (height, length, chest girth)

### Accuracy

High correlation with manual measurements (r > 0.90 for weight in many systems)

## Thermal Imaging

### Applications

1. **Health monitoring**: Elevated body temperature indicates fever or inflammation
2. **Heat stress detection**: Monitor heat load in animals
3. **Mastitis detection**: Udder temperature changes

### Challenges

Environmental factors affect measurements (ambient temperature, humidity)

## Video Analysis for Behavior

### Behaviors Tracked

- Eating and drinking: Time spent at feeder/drinker, feeding rate
- Social interactions: Aggression, mounting, grooming
- Lying and standing behavior: Posture classification
- Gait analysis: Lameness scoring from video
- Farrowing/calving monitoring: Detect parturition events

### Machine Learning

Train models to classify behaviors from video

## Computer Vision for Genetic Evaluation

### Novel Phenotypes

1. **Body composition traits**: 3D imaging provides accurate carcass predictions
2. **Feed efficiency**: Video analysis of feeding behavior
3. **Health traits**: Early disease detection (gait, posture, activity)
4. **Conformation**: Automated measurement of body dimensions
5. **Welfare traits**: Behavior-based indicators (fear response, social stress)

## Challenges

- **Environmental variability**: Lighting, dust, occlusions
- **Computational requirements**: Processing large video datasets
- **Model training**: Requires labeled data (ground truth)
- **Generalization**: Models trained on one farm may not work on another
- **Cost**: High-resolution cameras, computing infrastructure

## Future Directions

- Integration with genomic data (genotype-by-environment, resilience)
- Real-time alerts for health and welfare issues
- Scaling to commercial farms
- Multi-modal sensing (combine video, wearables, environmental sensors)

## Summary

Computer vision enables non-invasive, high-throughput phenotyping that provides novel traits for genetic selection.

## Key Points

- 3D imaging accurately estimates body weight and composition
- Machine learning is critical for analyzing video and image data
- Camera-based phenotyping provides novel traits for genetic selection
- Integration with breeding programs is expanding rapidly
