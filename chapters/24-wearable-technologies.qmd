# Wearable Technologies in Livestock {#sec-wearable-technologies}

## Overview

This chapter provides a detailed examination of wearable sensors (collars, ear tags, leg bands) for monitoring livestock.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Identify major types of wearable sensors and their applications
2. Explain how accelerometers are used for estrus detection and health monitoring
3. Understand how wearable data can be used in genetic evaluations
4. Recognize challenges in deploying wearable technologies
5. Interpret activity and behavior data from wearable sensors

### Collars

- Accelerometers
- GPS
- Microphones
- Body temperature sensors

### Ear Tags

- RFID (identification)
- Accelerometers
- Temperature sensors

### Leg Bands

- Accelerometers
- Pedometers (step counting)

### Rumen Boluses

- pH monitoring
- Temperature
- Pressure

## Accelerometers and Activity Monitoring

### Measured Parameters

- Activity level
- Lying time
- Standing time
- Step count
- Rumination time

### Applications

1. **Estrus detection**: Increased activity during estrus (dairy cows)
2. **Calving/farrowing detection**: Changes in lying patterns before parturition
3. **Lameness detection**: Reduced activity, altered gait, increased lying time
4. **Health monitoring**: Reduced activity as early indicator of disease
5. **Welfare assessment**: Lying time, rumination time as welfare indicators

### Commercial Systems

- Allflex
- SCR by Allflex
- IceQube
- RumiWatch
- Nedap

## Temperature Sensors

### Core Body Temperature

Early indicator of:
- Fever
- Heat stress
- Disease

### Rumen Boluses

Continuous temperature and pH monitoring

## GPS and Location Tracking

### Applications

- Grazing behavior
- Pasture utilization
- Locating animals in large pastures or rangeland
- Social interactions and resource use

## Acoustic Sensors (Microphones)

### Applications

- Cough detection (respiratory disease)
- Vocalization analysis (stress, pain, estrus)
- Rumination detection

## Wearables for Genetic Evaluation

### Novel Phenotypes

- **Feed efficiency**: Activity data helps explain variation in energy expenditure
- **Health traits**: Early disease detection enables phenotyping for resistance
- **Fertility**: Improved estrus detection increases accuracy of fertility EBVs
- **Temperament**: Activity patterns indicate stress response

## Data Quality and Validation

- Comparing sensor data to gold-standard measurements
- Calibration and drift correction
- Battery life and maintenance
- Missing data due to sensor failure or loss

## Challenges

- Cost per animal (especially for large herds)
- Battery life and replacement
- Data management infrastructure
- Validation of sensor accuracy

## Summary

Wearable sensors enable continuous, automated monitoring of behavior and physiology, providing novel phenotypes for genetic evaluation.

## Key Points

- Accelerometers are widely adopted for estrus and health detection
- Wearable data provides novel phenotypes for genetic evaluation
- Data quality and validation are critical for reliable use
