# Aquaculture Breeding {#sec-aquaculture-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter introduces aquaculture breeding with sections on salmon, trout, and shrimp.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the unique features of aquaculture breeding
2. Identify key traits for salmon, trout, and shrimp
3. Explain the role of family-based selection and genomic tools
4. Understand disease resistance as a major selection objective
5. Recognize the importance of DNA-based parentage assignment

## Aquaculture Industry Overview

::: {.callout-note}
## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development.
:::

- Fastest-growing animal protein sector globally
- Major species: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, tilapia, catfish, carp, shrimp

## Unique Features of Aquaculture Breeding

- **High fecundity**: Thousands to millions of offspring per female
- **External fertilization**: Enables family-based selection designs
- **Common environment**: Families reared together with DNA-based parentage
- **Rapid generation intervals**: 2-4 years for most species

## Salmon Breeding

### Key Traits

- Growth: h² = 0.25-0.40
- Disease resistance: h² = 0.10-0.30
- Flesh quality: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Sexual maturation: h² = 0.30-0.50

## Rainbow Trout Breeding

### Key Traits

- Growth rate: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Disease resistance: h² = 0.10-0.40
- Flesh quality

## Shrimp Breeding

### Key Traits (Pacific White Shrimp)

- Growth: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Survival: h² = 0.10-0.25
- Disease resistance: h² = 0.05-0.20

### Breeding Structure

- SPF (Specific Pathogen Free) lines
- Family-based selection with DNA parentage
- Genomic selection emerging

## Summary

Aquaculture breeding exploits high fecundity and family structures. Disease resistance is critical in aquaculture breeding programs.
