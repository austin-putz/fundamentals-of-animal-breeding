# Beef Cattle Breeding {#sec-beef-cattle-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter explains beef cattle breeding with emphasis on the seedstock industry, EPDs, and crossbreeding.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the structure of the beef cattle breeding industry
2. Interpret EPDs and use them for sire selection
3. Compare terminal and maternal breeding objectives
4. Design a crossbreeding system for commercial beef production
5. Explain the benefits of heterosis in beef cattle

## Breed Diversity

- **British breeds**: Angus, Hereford, Red Angus, Shorthorn
- **Continental breeds**: Charolais, Simmental, Limousin, Gelbvieh
- **Composite breeds**: Brangus, Beefmaster, Santa Gertrudis
- **Brahman influence**: Heat tolerance, parasite resistance

## Key Traits and Heritabilities

### Growth Traits

- Birth weight: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Weaning weight: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Yearling weight: h² = 0.30-0.50

### Carcass Traits

- Marbling: h² = 0.35-0.50
- Ribeye area: h² = 0.35-0.50

### Maternal Traits

- Milk production: h² = 0.10-0.30
- Calving ease: h² = 0.10-0.30

## EPDs (Expected Progeny Differences)

Content to be developed.

## Selection Indices

- Terminal indices (growth and carcass value)
- Maternal indices (calving ease, maternal ability)
- All-purpose indices

## Crossbreeding Systems

Content to be developed.

## Summary

Beef cattle breeding is decentralized with many independent breeders. EPDs are the standard genetic evaluation tool.
