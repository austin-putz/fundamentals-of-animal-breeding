# Poultry Breeding {#sec-poultry-breeding}

## Overview

This chapter explains unique features of poultry breeding with separate sections for broilers, layers, and turkeys.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. Describe the structure of integrated poultry breeding companies
2. Explain why poultry breeding allows rapid genetic progress
3. Compare breeding objectives for broilers, layers, and turkeys
4. Identify major genetic correlations affecting poultry breeding
5. Understand the role of family-based selection in poultry

## Global Poultry Industry Structure

::: {.callout-note}
## Chapter Status
This chapter is currently under development. Content will cover:

- Vertical integration (genetics, hatchery, grow-out, processing)
- Major breeding companies (Cobb-Vantress, Aviagen, Hy-Line International)
- Proprietary synthetic lines
- Closed nucleus populations

## Unique Features of Poultry Breeding

- Short generation intervals (9-12 months)
- High selection intensity
- Family-based selection
- Rapid genetic progress

## Broiler Breeding

### Key Traits

- Body weight at processing age: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Feed efficiency (FCR, RFI): h² = 0.25-0.40
- Carcass traits: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Leg health: h² = 0.10-0.30

### Breeding Objectives

Content to be developed.

## Egg-Laying Hen Breeding

### Key Traits

- Egg production: h² = 0.20-0.40
- Egg quality: h² = 0.30-0.60
- Feed efficiency: h² = 0.25-0.35

### Breeding Objectives

Content to be developed.

## Turkey Breeding

### Key Traits

- Growth: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Carcass traits: h² = 0.30-0.50
- Reproduction: h² = 0.05-0.15 (very low)

### Unique Challenges

Content to be developed.

## Summary

Poultry breeding is the most intensive and rapid form of livestock breeding, with short generation intervals enabling fast genetic progress.

## Key Points

- Short generation intervals and high selection intensity enable fast progress
- Genetic correlations between production and welfare require balanced selection
- Industry consolidation means a few companies supply global genetics
