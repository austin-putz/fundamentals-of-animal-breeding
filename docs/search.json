    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nAnimal breeding is both an ancient art and a modern science. For thousands of years, humans have selected superior animals as parents of the next generation, gradually transforming wild species into the highly productive domestic animals we know today. However, modern animal breeding has evolved far beyond simple selection—it now integrates advanced quantitative genetics, massive databases, sophisticated statistical models, economic analysis, and cutting-edge genomic technologies.\nThis chapter introduces you to the role and tools of today’s animal breeder. You’ll learn that successful breeding programs require a diverse skillset spanning multiple disciplines, from statistics to economics to molecular biology. You’ll discover how breeding companies are structured, how they generate revenue, and how genetics flows from elite nucleus populations to commercial farms. Finally, you’ll see that while the species may differ—swine, poultry, dairy cattle, beef cattle, or even aquaculture—the fundamental principles of genetic improvement remain universal.\nWelcome to the world of modern animal breeding!",

    "text": "1.2 1.1 The Universal Science of Genetic Improvement\n\n1.2.1 1.1.1 Defining Animal Breeding\nAt its core, animal breeding has a simple goal:\n\nSelect the best animals to be parents of the next generation.\n\nBut what does “best” mean? And best for what purpose? The answer depends on the breeding objective—the traits we want to improve. For dairy cattle, “best” might mean cows that produce more milk with better fertility and health. For swine, it might mean pigs that grow faster, more efficiently, and produce leaner carcasses. For broiler chickens, it might mean birds that reach market weight quickly with excellent feed conversion.\nThe ultimate goal of animal breeding is more precise:\n\nIncrease the mean genetic merit of a population over time.\n\nThis change in genetic merit over time is called genetic gain or, mathematically, ΔG (delta G, the change in genetic mean). Genetic gain is cumulative—improvements made in one generation are passed to the next, compounding over decades to create dramatic transformations in livestock productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGenetic Gain is Permanent\n\n\n\nUnlike environmental improvements (better nutrition, housing, or management), genetic improvements are permanent and cumulative. Once superior genes are fixed in a population, they remain in future generations. This is why animal breeding creates lasting value.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 1.1.2 Universal Principles\nThe principles you’ll learn in this course—quantitative genetics, selection theory, genetic evaluation, mating strategies—apply universally to all domesticated species:\n\n\nLivestock: Swine, cattle (dairy and beef), sheep, goats\n\nPoultry: Broilers (meat), layers (eggs), turkeys, ducks\n\nAquaculture: Salmon, trout, tilapia, shrimp\n\nCompanion animals: Dogs, cats, horses\n\nEven plants: The same statistical methods and breeding theories apply to crop improvement\n\nNo matter the species, the fundamental challenges are the same:\n\nDefine the breeding objective (what to improve)\nMeasure traits accurately (phenotyping)\nEstimate genetic merit (breeding values)\nSelect superior parents\nDesign optimal matings\nManage genetic diversity\n\nThis universality is powerful. The skills you develop in this course will prepare you for careers across the entire animal agriculture industry—and beyond.\n\n1.2.3 1.1.3 Breeding vs. Production: Changing Genes vs. Changing Environment\nIt’s critical to distinguish between breeding and production management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nBreeding\nProduction\n\n\n\nFocus\nChanging allele frequencies\n\nChanging environment\n\n\n\nTimeframe\nLong-term (generations)\nShort-term (immediate)\n\n\nEffect\nPermanent and cumulative\nTemporary (must be maintained)\n\n\nTools\nSelection, mating, genomics\nNutrition, housing, health management\n\n\nCost\nFront-loaded (data collection, evaluation)\nOngoing (feed, labor, facilities)\n\n\n\nExample: Improving feed efficiency\n\n\nProduction approach: Optimize feed formulation, reduce waste, improve gut health with additives\n\nEffect: Immediate improvement\nDuration: Only while management continues\n\n\n\nBreeding approach: Select animals with superior genetic feed efficiency (low RFI)\n\nEffect: Builds over generations\nDuration: Permanent—efficient genes pass to offspring\n\n\n\nBoth approaches are necessary and complementary, but breeding creates permanent, compounding value that continues long after the initial investment.",

    "text": "1.3 1.2 The Breeder’s Multidisciplinary Skill Set\nModern animal breeding is not a single discipline—it’s an integration of multiple fields. A successful breeder must be part statistician, part biologist, part economist, and part data scientist. Let’s explore the essential skills and why each matters.\n\n1.3.1 1.2.1 Quantitative Genetics & Statistics\nAt the heart of animal breeding lies quantitative genetics—the study of traits controlled by many genes, each with small effects. Most economically important traits (growth rate, milk production, litter size, feed efficiency) are quantitative, not simply inherited.\nKey concepts you’ll master in this course:\n\nHeritability (h²): The proportion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects. Determines how fast we can improve a trait through selection.\nGenetic correlations: How traits are genetically linked. Selecting for one trait (e.g., growth rate) inevitably affects others (e.g., backfat thickness).\nBreeding values: An animal’s genetic merit as a parent. The Estimated Breeding Value (EBV) or Expected Progeny Difference (EPD) is our best guess at an animal’s true genetic merit based on available data.\n\nStatistical models are essential for estimating breeding values:\n\n\nLinear mixed models: Account for fixed effects (e.g., contemporary groups) and random effects (genetic merit)\n\nBest Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP): The gold standard for estimating breeding values, using information from the individual, parents, progeny, and all relatives simultaneously\n\nGenomic prediction models: Incorporate DNA marker information to increase accuracy, especially for young animals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy Statistics?\n\n\n\nPhenotypes (what we observe) are influenced by both genetics and environment. Statistics allows us to partition variation:\n\\[\n\\text{Phenotype} = \\text{Genetics} + \\text{Environment}\n\\]\nOnly by accurately separating genetic from environmental effects can we identify the truly superior animals.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 1.2.2 Databases and Data Management\nBreeding programs generate massive amounts of data:\n\n\nPhenotypes: Birth weights, growth rates, ultrasound measurements, feed intake, reproductive records, health events\n\nPedigrees: Parentage for thousands or millions of animals\n\nGenotypes: SNP chip data (50,000 to 800,000 markers per animal)\n\nManagement data: Contemporary groups, pen assignments, treatment histories\n\nData integrity is paramount. A famous saying in computer science applies perfectly to animal breeding:\n\n“Garbage in, garbage out.”\n\nIf phenotypic data are inaccurate (e.g., swapped IDs, incorrect dates, measurement errors), the genetic evaluations will be flawed, and selection decisions will be wrong.\nRelational databases are the foundation of breeding programs:\n\n\nTables: Animals, Pedigree, Phenotypes, Genotypes\n\nKeys: Unique animal IDs link records across tables\n\nQueries: Extract data for analysis (using SQL)\n\nModern breeders must be comfortable working with databases, performing quality control, and ensuring data flows correctly from field collection to genetic evaluation.\n\n1.3.3 1.2.3 Economics and Economic Value\nNot all genetic improvement is created equal. Improving milk yield by 100 kg is not equally valuable to improving fertility by 5 days to conception—even though both might have similar heritabilities.\nThis is where economics enters breeding:\n\nEconomic weights (v): The value of a one-unit improvement in a trait, holding all others constant. Usually expressed in dollars per unit (e.g., $0.30 per kg of milk, $3 per day reduction in days open).\nSelection indices: Combine multiple traits weighted by their economic values to create a single selection criterion that maximizes profit. Examples: Net Merit (dairy), $W (beef), Sow Productivity Index (swine).\n\nCost-benefit analysis guides breeding decisions:\n\nIs it worth the cost of installing expensive automated feeders to measure individual feed intake, given the genetic gain expected in feed efficiency?\nShould we genotype all selection candidates ($50 per animal) or rely only on pedigree and phenotypes?\n\nBreeders must constantly balance genetic gain against cost, accuracy against speed, and short-term profit against long-term improvement.\n\n1.3.4 1.2.4 Production and Animal Science Knowledge\nAccurate phenotyping—measuring traits correctly—requires deep knowledge of animal biology and production systems:\n\n\nGrowth traits: Proper weighing procedures, accounting for gut fill, standardizing age\n\nCarcass traits: Ultrasound or CT scanning techniques, carcass dissection protocols\n\nReproductive traits: Estrus detection, pregnancy diagnosis, litter recording at birth\n\nFeed efficiency: Electronic feeders (e.g., GrowSafe, FIRE), individual vs. group housing\n\nHealth traits: Disease challenge studies, immune response assays, diagnostic lab results\n\nEnvironmental effects must be understood and modeled:\n\n\nContemporary groups: Animals raised together in the same environment (herd-year-season)\n\nManagement factors: Pen effects, batch effects, parity effects (for reproductive traits)\n\nSeasonal effects: Temperature, day length, feed availability\n\nWithout solid animal science knowledge, breeders cannot collect accurate data or properly account for environmental variation—leading to biased genetic evaluations.",

    "text": "1.4 1.3 The Industry Structure: The Breeding Pyramid\nMost livestock breeding industries are organized as hierarchical pyramid structures. Genetic improvement originates at the top (the nucleus) and flows downward through multiplier levels to the commercial production base. Understanding this structure is key to understanding how breeding programs operate.\n\n1.4.1 1.3.1 The Breeding Pyramid Model\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical structure of a breeding pyramid (e.g., swine). Selection intensity is highest at the nucleus, and genetics flow downward to commercial production.\n\n\n\nThe pyramid has three main levels:\n1. Nucleus (Apex)\n\n\nPopulation: Small, elite group of purebred animals (typically 2,000-10,000 breeding animals)\n\nGoal: Maximize genetic gain through intense selection and advanced technologies\n\nSelection intensity: Highest (top 1-10% selected as parents)\n\nTools: Complete phenotyping, pedigree analysis, genomic selection, progeny testing\n\nOwnership: Genetics companies own and operate nucleus herds/flocks\n\nExamples: - Swine: Genus (PIC, Hypor), Topigs Norsvin nucleus farms with purebred Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Pietrain lines - Poultry: Cobb-Vantress, Aviagen great-grandparent lines (proprietary genetics) - Dairy: Elite bull dams and young genomic sires at AI studs (Select Sires, ABS Global, Alta Genetics)\n2. Multiplier (Middle Tier)\n\n\nPopulation: Larger population (~50,000-500,000 animals) that receives genetics from the nucleus\n\nGoal: Propagate superior genetics, often creating crossbred maternal lines (F₁ females)\n\nSelection intensity: Moderate (primarily for reproductive success, not genetic improvement)\n\nFunction: Expand numbers to supply commercial production\n\nExamples: - Swine: Multiplier farms produce F₁ gilts (Large White × Landrace) that are sold to commercial producers - Poultry: Grandparent and parent stock farms that produce hatching eggs - Dairy: Not applicable (semen disseminated directly via AI)\n3. Commercial (Base)\n\n\nPopulation: Vast (millions to billions of animals globally)\n\nGoal: Maximize production and profit using crossbred genetics from above\n\nSelection intensity: Minimal or none (animals typically slaughtered or culled after production cycle)\n\nFocus: Production management, not genetic improvement\n\nExamples: - Swine: Commercial sow farms using F₁ gilts mated to terminal sires (Duroc, Pietrain) to produce market hogs - Poultry: Commercial broiler farms raising chickens from 1 day to ~42 days (slaughter) - Dairy: Commercial dairy farms using semen from elite bulls\n\n1.4.2 1.3.2 Species-Specific Pyramids\nSwine: A Classic Three-Tier Pyramid\nThe swine industry exemplifies the pyramid structure:\nNucleus → Purebred lines (Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Pietrain) maintained by genetics companies\nMultiplier → Produces F₁ crossbred gilts: - (Large White ♂ × Landrace ♀) → F₁ gilt (maternal line, excellent reproductive traits)\nCommercial → F₁ gilts mated to terminal sire: - (F₁ ♀ × Duroc ♂) → Market pigs (three-way cross, optimized for growth and carcass)\nGenetic flow: One-directional, from nucleus → multiplier → commercial\nKey companies: - Genus (PIC, Hypor): ~$500M annual revenue - Topigs Norsvin: European leader, cooperative structure - Genesus: Smaller but growing, direct-to-farm model\nPoultry: Four-Tier Proprietary Genetics\nPoultry (broilers and layers) use a four-tier structure with proprietary synthetic lines (not breed-based):\nGreat-Grandparent (GGP) → Elite nucleus lines (pure lines A, B, C, D)\nGrandparent (GP) → Crosses of pure lines (AB × CD)\nParent Stock (PS) → Commercial layer that produces hatching eggs\nCommercial → Broilers (slaughter at ~6 weeks) or layers (egg production)\nOwnership: Highly concentrated—3-4 companies control ~90% of global broiler genetics: - Cobb-Vantress (Tyson Foods): ~40% market share - Aviagen (EW Group): ~35% market share - Hubbard (Groupe Grimaud): ~15% - Hybrid Turkeys (Hendrix Genetics): Turkeys\nGenetic flow: Strictly controlled through contracts; multiplier farms cannot breed their own replacements.\nDairy: AI-Based Dissemination\nDairy cattle breeding does not follow a strict pyramid—instead, it relies on artificial insemination (AI) to disseminate elite bull genetics globally.\nElite nucleus → Bull dams and young genomic sires selected through progeny testing or genomic evaluation\nAI studs → Collect, process, and distribute semen from proven or genomic bulls\nCommercial farms → Use AI to breed cows, selecting bulls based on Net Merit index or other breeding goals\nKey companies: - Select Sires: US cooperative, farmer-owned - ABS Global: Private, international - Alta Genetics: Canadian cooperative - CRV: Dutch cooperative\nGenetic flow: Primarily through semen; some embryo transfer (ET) for elite females.\nBeef: Seedstock Producers and Breed Associations\nBeef cattle breeding is more decentralized:\nSeedstock producers → Registered purebred herds (Angus, Hereford, Simmental, etc.), focus on selling breeding stock (bulls, heifers) and semen\nCommercial cow-calf operations → Purchase bulls or semen from seedstock producers, often crossbreed for hybrid vigor\nBreed associations → Perform genetic evaluations, publish EPDs (Expected Progeny Differences), maintain registries\nKey organizations: - American Angus Association: Largest beef breed registry (~300,000 members) - Red Angus Association of America - Simmental, Hereford, Charolais breed associations\nGenetic flow: Bulls and semen from seedstock producers → commercial herds.\n\n1.4.3 1.3.3 The Role of Artificial Insemination (AI)\nArtificial insemination is the most important technology for disseminating superior male genetics:\nHow AI Works\n\n\nSemen collection: Males trained to mount dummy or live female; semen collected via artificial vagina\n\nEvaluation: Sperm count, motility, morphology assessed\n\nExtension and dilution: Semen diluted with extender (nutrients, antibiotics, cryoprotectant)\n\nFreezing: Packaged in straws (0.5 mL or 0.25 mL), frozen in liquid nitrogen (-196°C)\n\nStorage: Indefinite storage in liquid nitrogen tanks\n\nDistribution: Shipped globally to farms, thawed at point of use\n\nInsemination: Deposited into female reproductive tract (cervix or uterus) at optimal time\nImpact of AI\nAI dramatically increases the selection intensity for males:\n\n\nWithout AI: A bull might sire 20-50 calves per year (natural mating)\n\nWith AI: A single ejaculate can produce hundreds of doses; elite bulls sire thousands to tens of thousands of offspring globally\n\nExample: A top Holstein bull may have &gt;100,000 daughters worldwide, allowing extremely accurate progeny testing (before genomics) or validation of genomic predictions.\nAI by Species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAI Adoption Rate\nPrimary Use\n\n\n\nDairy cattle\n&gt;90% (USA, Europe)\nNearly universal for breeding\n\n\nBeef cattle\n~10-15% (USA)\nMainly seedstock herds; natural mating common in commercial herds\n\n\nSwine\n&gt;95% (commercial)\nStandard practice; boar studs supply semen\n\n\nPoultry\n&lt;5%\nNatural mating predominates (roosters kept with hens)\n\n\nSheep\n5-10%\nSeasonal breeding, labor-intensive",

    "text": "1.6 1.5 The Central Process: Selection and Evaluation\nAt the heart of every breeding program lies a systematic process for identifying and selecting superior animals. Let’s walk through the steps.\n\n1.6.1 1.5.1 Step 1: Defining the Breeding Objective\nThe first critical question: What traits should we improve?\nThis depends on: - Market demands: What do customers value? (lean meat, milk components, egg size, growth rate) - Production costs: What drives profitability? (feed efficiency, reproductive rate, health) - Sustainability goals: Environmental impact, animal welfare\nCommon breeding objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nKey Traits in Breeding Objective\n\n\n\nSwine\nGrowth rate, feed efficiency, litter size, carcass leanness, meat quality\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight at 42 days, feed conversion, breast meat yield, leg health\n\n\nLayers\nEgg production, egg weight, shell quality, feed efficiency, mortality\n\n\nDairy\nMilk yield, milk fat %, milk protein %, fertility, udder health, longevity\n\n\nBeef\nWeaning weight, yearling weight, carcass weight, marbling, tenderness, calving ease\n\n\n\nMost breeding programs target 5-15 traits simultaneously, requiring multi-trait selection (covered in Chapter 9).\n\n1.6.2 1.5.2 Step 2: Phenotyping and Data Acquisition\nPhenotyping is the process of accurately measuring traits on individual animals or groups.\nChallenges in Phenotyping\n\n\nCost: Automated feeders for individual feed intake cost $50,000-$100,000+ per pen\n\nTime: Some traits (e.g., longevity) require years to measure\n\nInvasiveness: Carcass traits require slaughter; some health traits require biopsies or blood samples\n\nAccuracy: Measurement error reduces heritability and slows genetic gain\nModern Phenotyping Technologies\n\n\nAutomated feeders (e.g., GrowSafe, FIRE): Measure individual feed intake in group-housed pigs or cattle\n\nWalk-over-weighing (WOW): Automatic scales record weights as animals pass through\n\nUltrasound: Non-invasive carcass trait measurement (backfat, loin depth)\n\nCT/MRI scanning: High-resolution carcass composition in live animals\n\nMilking robots: Automatically record milk yield, components, and milking speed per cow\n\nAutomated egg counters: Track individual hen production via RFID nest boxes\n\nWearable sensors: Activity monitors, rumination sensors, estrus detection collars\n\nLab assays: Immune response, metabolic profiles, gene expression\n\nExample: Swine feed efficiency (Residual Feed Intake, RFI)\n\n\nTraditional: Hand-feeding, weighing back refused feed → labor-intensive, inaccurate\n\nModern: Electronic RFID feeders record each pig’s daily feed intake automatically over 8-12 weeks → accurate, high-throughput\n\n\n1.6.3 1.5.3 Step 3: Genetic Evaluation (Estimating Breeding Values)\nOnce phenotypes are collected, we must estimate genetic merit for each animal.\nWhy Not Just Select on Phenotype?\nPhenotype = Genetics + Environment\nAn animal with a high phenotype might: - Be genetically superior (we want to select this animal) - Be in a favorable environment (e.g., best pen, best management) - Have favorable non-additive effects (dominance, epistasis) that don’t pass to offspring\nWe need to separate genetic from environmental effects and estimate each animal’s breeding value.\nEstimated Breeding Values (EBVs)\nThe breeding value is the sum of the additive effects of an animal’s genes. It represents genetic merit as a parent.\nThe Estimated Breeding Value (EBV) is our statistical prediction of true breeding value based on: - The animal’s own phenotype - Phenotypes of relatives (parents, siblings, offspring) - Pedigree information - Genomic information (DNA markers)\nModern methods: - BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction): Uses linear mixed models to estimate breeding values, accounting for fixed effects (contemporary groups) and relationships among all animals - Genomic BLUP (GBLUP): Incorporates SNP chip data to improve accuracy, especially for young animals without phenotypes\nWe’ll cover EBV estimation in detail in Chapter 7.\n\n1.6.4 1.5.4 Step 4: Introduction to Genomic Selection\nTraditional selection relied on: - Own performance: Requires waiting for the animal to mature and have phenotypes - Progeny testing: Requires waiting for offspring to be born and measured (slow!)\nGenomic selection changed everything:\nBy genotyping animals with SNP chips (DNA arrays measuring 50,000-800,000 genetic markers), we can: - Predict breeding values at birth (or even as embryos) - Increase accuracy for traits that are expensive to measure (e.g., feed efficiency, carcass quality, disease resistance) - Reduce generation interval (time between generations) by selecting young animals\nImpact: - Dairy: Generation interval reduced from ~6 years (progeny testing) to ~2.5 years (genomic selection) → doubled rate of genetic gain - Swine: Enabled selection for feed efficiency (RFI) without phenotyping all candidates - Poultry: High accuracy for traits like disease resistance and leg health\nWe’ll explore genomic selection in Chapters 12-13.",

Now we turn to the practical foundation of every breeding program: What are we actually trying to improve, and how do we measure it?\nImagine you’re a geneticist at a swine breeding company. Your team has been tasked with improving growth rate in your terminal sire line. This sounds straightforward—select faster-growing pigs as parents. But as you’ll discover in this chapter, this seemingly simple goal raises many critical questions:\n\n\nWhat trait exactly should we measure? Body weight at a specific age? Average daily gain over a period? Weight at a target backfat depth?\n\nHow do we measure it accurately? Manual weighing? Automated scales? How often?\n\nHow do we record and manage the data? What if an ID tag is misread or a weight is entered incorrectly?\n\nIs growth rate the only thing that matters? What about feed efficiency, carcass quality, leg soundness, or meat quality?\n\nHow do we know which pigs are genetically superior vs. just raised in a better environment?\n\nThis chapter addresses these foundational questions. We’ll explore:\n\n\nTraits of economic importance: The characteristics that drive profitability in livestock production\n\nPhenotypes and phenotyping: What we observe and how we measure it accurately\n\nData recording and management: The critical infrastructure that makes breeding programs work\n\nBreeding objectives: Defining what traits to improve and their relative importance\n\nTrue Breeding Value (TBV): The concept of genetic merit that underpins all selection decisions\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you’ll understand that successful animal breeding depends not just on sophisticated statistical models (which we’ll cover in later chapters), but on high-quality data collected systematically over time. As the saying goes: “Garbage in, garbage out.” Without accurate phenotypes and clear breeding objectives, no amount of statistical wizardry can produce genetic progress.\nLet’s begin by exploring the traits that matter in livestock breeding.",

    "text": "2.2 Traits of Economic Importance\nNot all traits are created equal when it comes to livestock breeding. Some traits directly determine revenue (milk sold, eggs produced, carcass weight), while others affect costs (feed consumption, veterinary treatments, mortality). Still others influence long-term sustainability (longevity, welfare, environmental impact).\nTraits of economic importance can be organized into six major categories. As we explore each category, notice how the same principles apply across species, but the specific traits and their relative importance vary by production system.\n\n2.2.1 2.1 Production Traits\nProduction traits are the most visible and often the most emphasized—they directly determine the quantity of product (meat, milk, eggs) an animal produces.\nGrowth Rate\nGrowth rate measures how quickly an animal gains body weight over time. It’s critical for meat-producing species where animals are raised to a target market weight.\nCommon measurements:\n\nAverage Daily Gain (ADG): Body weight gain per day over a defined period \\[\\text{ADG} = \\frac{\\text{Final Weight} - \\text{Initial Weight}}{\\text{Days on Test}}\\]\nBody weight at fixed age: E.g., broiler weight at 42 days, pig weight at 150 days\n\nSpecies-specific examples:\n\n\nSpecies\nTrait\nTypical Range\nUnits\n\n\n\nSwine\nADG from 25-110 kg\n800-1,000 g/day\ng/day\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight at 42 days\n2.4-2.8 kg\nkg\n\n\nBeef cattle\nWeaning weight (adjusted 205d)\n180-250 kg\nkg\n\n\nBeef cattle\nYearling weight (adjusted 365d)\n350-450 kg\nkg\n\n\nLayers\nBody weight at 18 weeks\n1.3-1.5 kg\nkg\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: Faster growth means: - Shorter time to market (reduced facility and labor costs) - More production cycles per year - Greater throughput and revenue\nHowever, there can be trade-offs: Extremely fast growth can lead to leg problems (broilers), increased backfat (swine), or metabolic issues.\nMilk Yield\nFor dairy cattle, milk production is the primary revenue-generating trait.\nMeasurement: - 305-day lactation yield: Total milk produced in first 305 days of lactation (kg) - Test-day records: Monthly milk weights via DHI (Dairy Herd Improvement) testing or daily via automated milking systems\nTypical values: - Elite Holsteins: 10,000-14,000 kg per 305-day lactation - Average Holsteins (USA): ~10,000 kg - Jersey cattle: 6,000-8,000 kg (but higher components)\nEconomic importance: At $0.35-0.45 per kg milk, a cow producing 1,000 kg more per lactation generates $350-450 extra revenue.\nHowever, genetic selection for extremely high milk yield has been associated with: - Reduced fertility (longer days open, lower conception rates) - Increased metabolic disorders (ketosis, displaced abomasum) - Shorter productive life (more culling)\nThis is why modern breeding objectives balance milk yield with health and fertility (more on this in Section 2.5).\nEgg Production\nFor laying hens, the number of eggs produced over the hen’s productive life determines revenue.\nMeasurement: - Eggs per hen housed: Total eggs from point of housing (e.g., 18 weeks) to end of lay cycle (e.g., 80 weeks) - Peak production: Maximum eggs per 100 hens per day (e.g., 95-98%) - Persistency: Maintenance of production after peak\nTypical values: - Modern commercial layers: 320-350 eggs per hen housed (18-80 weeks) - Peak rates: 95-98 eggs per 100 hens per day\nEconomic importance: At $0.10-0.15 per egg (farm gate), an extra 20 eggs per hen = $2.00-3.00 additional revenue per hen.\nEgg production is highly heritable (h² ≈ 0.25-0.35), making it responsive to selection. However, breeders must also consider: - Egg weight: Larger eggs have premium value but may reduce total egg numbers - Shell quality: Cracked eggs are unsellable - Feed efficiency: Feed costs dominate layer economics\nFeed Intake\nWhile not a traditional “production” trait, feed intake is measured extensively because it’s necessary for calculating feed efficiency (Section 2.4).\nMeasurement: - Daily feed intake (kg/day or g/day) - Cumulative feed intake over test period\nTechnologies: - Electronic feeders: FIRE systems (swine), GrowSafe (cattle), automated poultry feeders - RFID-enabled: Each animal identified when accessing feeder, intake recorded automatically\nTypical values: - Growing-finishing pigs (25-110 kg): 1.8-2.5 kg/day - Dairy cows (lactating): 20-28 kg dry matter/day - Broilers (1-42 days): Cumulative ~3.5-4.5 kg - Beef steers (feedlot): 10-14 kg dry matter/day\n\n2.2.2 2.2 Reproductive Traits\nReproductive traits determine how many offspring an animal produces over its lifetime. These traits are economically critical but present unique breeding challenges—they typically have low heritability (h² &lt; 0.15) and are often sex-limited (expressed only in one sex).\nLitter Size (Swine)\nLitter size measures the number of offspring born per litter in polytocous species (those that produce multiple offspring).\nCommon measurements: - Total born (TB): Total piglets born (alive + stillborn) - Number born alive (NBA): Live piglets at birth - Number weaned (NW): Piglets surviving to weaning (~21 days)\nTypical values (modern commercial sows): - Total born: 13-16 piglets - Born alive: 12-14 piglets - Weaned: 11-13 piglets\nEconomic importance: At $50 per weaned pig, one extra pig weaned per litter × 2.3 litters per sow per year = $115 extra revenue per sow per year.\nBreeding challenge: Litter size has very low heritability (h² ≈ 0.10-0.15), meaning: - Most variation is environmental (sow condition, nutrition, management) - Genetic progress is slow - Requires large datasets and accurate pedigrees - Genomic selection helps increase accuracy\nFertility\nFertility encompasses the ability to conceive and maintain pregnancy.\nCommon measurements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nTrait\nDefinition\nTypical Value\n\n\n\nDairy\nDaughter Pregnancy Rate (DPR)\n% pregnant per 21-day cycle\n18-25%\n\n\nDairy\nDays Open\nDays from calving to conception\n100-150 days\n\n\nBeef\nHeifer Pregnancy (HP)\n% heifers pregnant at ~14 months\n85-95%\n\n\nBeef\nFirst Service Conception Rate\n% pregnant after first insemination\n50-65%\n\n\nSwine\nFarrowing rate\n% of mated sows that farrow\n85-90%\n\n\nLayers\nSexual maturity\nAge at first egg\n18-20 weeks\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: - Dairy: Each extra day open costs ~$3-5 (delayed lactation, increased breeding costs) - Beef: Open cows generate no calf crop and still incur maintenance costs\nHeritability: Generally low (h² ≈ 0.03-0.10 for most fertility traits), making improvement difficult but not impossible with genomic selection and large datasets.\nCalving/Farrowing Ease\nDystocia (difficult birth) causes calf/piglet mortality, maternal injury, and increased labor.\nMeasurement: - Calving ease score: 1 (unassisted) to 5 (extreme difficulty, caesarean section) - Birth weight: Often used as predictor (heavier calves/piglets → more dystocia) - Percentage unassisted births\nTypical values: - Beef cattle: 85-95% unassisted births (heifers lower) - Dairy: 90-95% unassisted births - Swine: Farrowing duration, stillborn rate (indicator)\nHeritability: - Direct calving ease (calf’s effect): h² ≈ 0.05-0.15 - Maternal calving ease (cow’s pelvic capacity): h² ≈ 0.10-0.20\nBreeding strategy: Select terminal sires with negative EPD for birth weight (smaller, easier-born calves), especially for use on heifers.\n\n2.2.3 2.3 Health and Fitness Traits\nHealth traits are increasingly important in breeding programs as producers, consumers, and regulators focus on animal welfare and reducing antibiotic use.\nDisease Resistance\nDisease resistance measures an animal’s ability to avoid infection or minimize disease severity.\nExamples by species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nDisease\nMeasurement\nHeritability\n\n\n\nDairy\nMastitis\nSomatic Cell Score (SCC)\nh² ≈ 0.10-0.15\n\n\nDairy\nLameness\nMobility score, foot lesions\nh² ≈ 0.05-0.15\n\n\nSwine\nPRRS resistance\nViremia, weight loss\nh² ≈ 0.15-0.30\n\n\nPoultry\nNewcastle disease\nAntibody titer, mortality\nh² ≈ 0.10-0.30\n\n\nSalmon\nIPN (infectious pancreatic necrosis)\nSurvival post-challenge\nh² ≈ 0.15-0.40\n\n\n\nMeasurement challenges: - Disease challenge tests: Expensive, require controlled exposure - Natural disease incidence: Depends on pathogen exposure (environmental) - Genomic selection: Increasingly used for disease traits (identify resistant genotypes without challenge)\nEconomic importance: - Mastitis (dairy): ~$200-300 per case (treatment, milk loss, culling) - PRRS (swine): ~$5-10 per pig in mortality, reduced growth - Diseases reduce animal welfare and necessitate antibiotic use\nLongevity and Stayability\nLongevity measures how long an animal remains productive in the herd.\nCommon measurements: - Productive life (dairy): Months from first calving to culling - Stayability (beef): Probability cow remains in herd to age 6, having weaned 5+ calves - Survival (poultry): Mortality rate from housing to end of lay\nTypical values: - Dairy: Average productive life ~2.5-3.5 lactations (goal: &gt;4) - Beef: Stayability to age 6: ~60-75% - Layers: Mortality 18-80 weeks: 3-8%\nEconomic importance: - Dairy: Each extra lactation = ~$500-1,000 saved (replacement cost, calf value) - Beef: Cows that stay in herd longer amortize their development costs over more calves\nHeritability: Low to moderate (h² ≈ 0.05-0.15), but selection indices increasingly include longevity due to its economic impact.\n\n2.2.4 2.4 Efficiency Traits\nEfficiency traits measure how effectively animals convert inputs (primarily feed) into outputs (meat, milk, eggs). With feed representing 60-70% of production costs, efficiency is economically critical.\nFeed Efficiency: RFI vs. FCR\nThere are two main ways to express feed efficiency:\n1. Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)\n\\[\\text{FCR} = \\frac{\\text{Feed Intake}}{\\text{Body Weight Gain}}\\]\n\n\nLower FCR is better (less feed per kg gain)\nTypical values:\n\n\nBroilers: 1.5-1.8 kg feed per kg gain\n\nSwine: 2.4-2.8 kg feed per kg gain\n\nBeef cattle: 5.5-7.5 kg feed per kg gain\n\n\n\nLimitation: FCR is confounded with growth rate. Fast-growing animals naturally have better FCR (less feed for maintenance per kg gain).\n2. Residual Feed Intake (RFI)\nRFI is the difference between an animal’s actual feed intake and its expected feed intake based on body weight and gain.\n\\[\\text{RFI} = \\text{Actual Feed Intake} - \\text{Expected Feed Intake}\\]\n\n\nNegative RFI is better (eats less than expected for its size and growth)\n\nRFI is independent of growth rate (you can select for low RFI without reducing growth)\n\nExample (swine): - Pig A: Grows 900 g/day, eats 2.0 kg/day → Expected intake: 2.1 kg/day → RFI = 2.0 - 2.1 = -0.1 kg/day (efficient!) - Pig B: Grows 900 g/day, eats 2.4 kg/day → Expected intake: 2.1 kg/day → RFI = 2.4 - 2.1 = +0.3 kg/day (inefficient)\nHeritability: - FCR: h² ≈ 0.25-0.40 - RFI: h² ≈ 0.30-0.45\nWhy measure RFI? RFI is more expensive to measure (requires individual feed intake), but it allows: - Selection for efficiency without reducing growth - Improved profitability: Reducing RFI by 0.1 kg/day = ~5-8 kg less feed per pig (~$2-3 saved)\nPartial Efficiency Traits\n\n\nFeed per kg milk (dairy): kg dry matter intake per kg milk produced\n\nFeed per dozen eggs (layers): kg feed per 12 eggs\n\nResidual energy intake (dairy): Similar to RFI, accounting for milk production and body weight change\n\n2.2.5 2.5 Quality Traits\nQuality traits determine product value—consumers and processors pay premiums for higher-quality products.\nCarcass Composition (Meat Animals)\nKey traits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nSpecies\nMeasurement\nTypical Range\n\n\n\nBackfat depth\nSwine\nUltrasound, carcass\n10-18 mm\n\n\nLoin depth\nSwine\nUltrasound, carcass\n50-70 mm\n\n\nMarbling score\nBeef\nVisual, camera grading\n3-8 (USDA scale)\n\n\nRibeye area\nBeef\nCarcass measurement\n75-95 cm²\n\n\nBreast meat yield\nBroilers\nProcessing plant data\n21-26% of live weight\n\n\nPercent lean\nSwine\nCalculated from carcass\n55-62%\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: - Swine: Each mm less backfat = ~$0.50-1.00 per carcass (leaner = higher value) - Beef: Marbling score increase (Choice to Prime) = $50-150 premium per carcass - Broilers: 1% increase in breast yield = ~$0.05-0.10 per bird\nHeritability: Moderate to high (h² ≈ 0.30-0.60), making carcass traits highly responsive to selection.\nMilk Components (Dairy)\nMilk is priced based on component content, not just volume.\nKey traits: - Fat %: Typically 3.5-4.5% in Holsteins, 4.5-6.0% in Jerseys - Protein %: Typically 3.0-3.5% in Holsteins, 3.5-4.0% in Jerseys - Fat yield (kg): Total kg fat = % × milk yield - Protein yield (kg): Total kg protein = % × milk yield\nEconomic importance: Milk payment formulas often reward components more than volume. Example: - $0.30 per kg milk + $2.50 per kg fat + $4.00 per kg protein\nGenetic correlations: - Milk yield vs. fat%: Negative (r_A ≈ -0.3 to -0.5) — selecting for volume reduces % - Milk yield vs. fat kg: Positive (r_A ≈ +0.5 to +0.7) — more volume = more total fat - Fat% vs. protein%: Positive (r_A ≈ +0.6) — tend to move together\nEgg Quality (Layers)\nKey traits: - Egg weight: 55-65 g (premium for larger eggs, but size must fit carton) - Shell strength: Breaking force (kg), shell thickness (mm) - Shell color: Brown vs. white (market preference, no quality difference) - Internal quality: Albumin height, Haugh units (measure of freshness) - Yolk color: Fan score (1-15), driven by diet and genetics\nEconomic importance: - Cracked eggs: 6-10% loss; shell strength reduces cracks - Egg size: Premium for large/extra-large grades\nHeritability: Generally moderate to high (h² ≈ 0.30-0.60 for most egg quality traits).\nMeat Quality\n\n\npH: Ultimate pH (pHu) after rigor mortis — affects water-holding capacity, color\n\n\nSwine: Normal pHu = 5.6-5.8; PSE (pale, soft, exudative) if &lt; 5.4\n\n\n\nColor: L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness) — consumer preference for darker red meat\n\nTenderness: Warner-Bratzler shear force (lower = more tender) — major quality factor in beef\n\nIntramuscular fat: Marbling — associated with tenderness, flavor, juiciness\n\nHeritability: Moderate (h² ≈ 0.20-0.50 for most meat quality traits).\n\n2.2.6 2.6 Welfare Traits\nAnimal welfare is increasingly important to consumers, retailers, and regulations. Welfare traits are challenging to define and measure but are entering breeding programs.\nTemperament and Behavior\nMeasurement: - Temperament scores: Docility during handling (1 = calm, 5 = aggressive) - Flight speed: Time to exit a chute (cattle) — faster = more excitable - Fear response: Tonic immobility test (poultry), open field test\nTypical heritability: h² ≈ 0.10-0.40 depending on trait and measurement method\nEconomic importance: - Cattle: Calm temperament improves safety for handlers, reduces stress-induced weight loss - Swine: Aggressive pigs cause injuries, tail biting - Poultry: Feather pecking and cannibalism reduce welfare and productivity\nLeg and Foot Health\nLeg problems are a major welfare concern, especially in fast-growing broilers and high-producing dairy cows.\nExamples: - Broilers: Leg scores (gait analysis, 0 = normal to 5 = severe lameness) - Dairy: Locomotion scores (1 = sound to 5 = severely lame) - Swine: Leg soundness, osteochondrosis\nHeritability: Low to moderate (h² ≈ 0.05-0.20)\nSelection challenge: Leg problems are often genetically correlated with production traits: - Broilers: Fast growth → heavier body weight → increased leg stress - Dairy: High milk yield → increased metabolic stress → increased lameness risk\nModern breeding programs use multi-trait selection to balance production with leg health.\nAbsence of Genetic Defects\nSome welfare issues are caused by deleterious recessive alleles. Examples: - Cattle: Hypotrichosis (hairlessness), chondrodysplasia (dwarfism) - Dogs: Hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, brachycephalic syndrome\nBreeding strategy: - DNA testing: Identify carriers of recessive alleles - Mating strategies: Avoid carrier × carrier matings (produces affected offspring) - Selection against carriers: Gradually reduce allele frequency\n\n2.2.7 2.7 Summary Table: Key Traits by Species\nThe table below summarizes economically important traits across major livestock species, providing typical values and approximate heritabilities. These values will become more meaningful as we cover heritability in detail in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Economically important traits in major livestock species\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nSpecies\nTrait\nTypical Value\nHeritability (h²)\n\n\n\nProduction\nSwine\nADG (25-110 kg)\n850-950 g/d\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nDairy\n305-d milk yield\n10,000 kg\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nBeef\nWeaning weight\n220 kg\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight (42d)\n2.6 kg\n0.30-0.50\n\n\n\nLayers\nEggs/hen (18-80 wk)\n330 eggs\n0.25-0.35\n\n\nReproduction\nSwine\nNBA (born alive)\n12-14 pigs\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nDairy\nDaughter pregnancy rate\n20%\n0.03-0.05\n\n\n\nBeef\nHeifer pregnancy\n90%\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nLayers\nAge at first egg\n19 wk\n0.40-0.50\n\n\nHealth/Fitness\nDairy\nSomatic cell score\n3.0-3.5\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nSwine\nPRRS resistance\nVariable\n0.15-0.30\n\n\n\nBroilers\nLeg soundness score\n1.5 (0-5 scale)\n0.05-0.20\n\n\nEfficiency\nSwine\nRFI (feed efficiency)\n-0.05 kg/d\n0.30-0.45\n\n\n\nBeef\nRFI (feedlot)\n-0.2 kg/d\n0.30-0.45\n\n\n\nLayers\nFeed per dozen eggs\n1.6 kg\n0.25-0.40\n\n\nQuality\nSwine\nBackfat depth\n12 mm\n0.40-0.60\n\n\n\nBeef\nMarbling score\n5.5 (3-8 scale)\n0.35-0.50\n\n\n\nLayers\nEgg weight\n62 g\n0.50-0.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy Heritability Matters\n\n\n\nHeritability (h²) is the proportion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects (Chapter 5). Key takeaways:\n\n\nHigh heritability (h² &gt; 0.40): Traits respond quickly to selection (growth, carcass, egg weight)\n\nModerate heritability (h² = 0.20-0.40): Steady progress possible (milk yield, feed efficiency)\n\nLow heritability (h² &lt; 0.20): Slow progress, requires large datasets and genomic tools (fertility, disease resistance)\n\nNotice that reproductive and health traits typically have low heritability—this is why modern breeding increasingly relies on genomic selection to improve accuracy for these difficult traits.",

    "text": "2.3 Phenotypes and Phenotyping\nNow that we’ve identified what traits matter, we turn to the practical challenge of measuring them accurately. This process—called phenotyping—is the foundation of all genetic improvement. Without high-quality phenotypes, genetic evaluations will be biased, selection decisions will be wrong, and genetic progress will stall.\nAs you’ll see in this section, phenotyping is far more than simply “weighing a pig” or “counting eggs.” It requires careful attention to measurement protocols, equipment calibration, data recording, and quality control.\n\n2.3.1 3.1 What is a Phenotype?\nA phenotype is any observable or measurable characteristic of an organism. In animal breeding, phenotypes are the traits we record on individual animals—body weight, milk yield, egg production, backfat depth, disease incidence, temperament, and so on.\nDefinition:\n\nPhenotype: The observable expression of an animal’s genotype in a specific environment.\n\nMathematically, we can express the phenotype as:\n\\[P = G + E\\]\nWhere: - P = Phenotype (what we observe and measure) - G = Genotype (genetic contribution, sum of all genetic effects) - E = Environment (all non-genetic factors: nutrition, management, health, weather, measurement error)\nWe’ll formalize this model in Chapter 3 by partitioning the genetic component (\\(G\\)) into additive, dominance, and epistatic effects. For now, the key insight is that phenotype ≠ genotype. An animal with a high phenotype may be:\n\n\nGenetically superior (large \\(G\\))\n\nIn a favorable environment (large positive \\(E\\))\nBoth\n\nLucky (random environmental advantage)\n\nExample: Two pigs, both weighing 110 kg at 150 days of age\n\n\nPig A: Comes from a genetically superior line (parents had high EBVs), raised in average conditions\n\n\n\\(G\\) = high, \\(E\\) = average → \\(P\\) = 110 kg\n\n\n\nPig B: Comes from average parents (moderate EBVs), raised in exceptionally favorable conditions (best pen, extra feeding attention)\n\n\n\\(G\\) = average, \\(E\\) = high → \\(P\\) = 110 kg\n\n\n\nBoth pigs have identical phenotypes (110 kg), but Pig A is the better breeding animal because its phenotype reflects superior genetics, not just favorable environment. The challenge of animal breeding is to estimate \\(G\\) from \\(P\\), which requires accounting for environmental variation.\n\n2.3.2 3.2 Measurement Accuracy and Precision\nNot all phenotypic measurements are created equal. The quality of phenotypic data depends on two distinct properties: accuracy and precision.\nAccuracy\nAccuracy measures how close a measurement is to the true value.\n\n\nHigh accuracy: Measurements are close to the true value on average\n\nLow accuracy: Measurements are systematically biased (e.g., scale consistently reads 2 kg too high)\n\nSources of inaccuracy: - Uncalibrated equipment (scales, ultrasound machines) - Systematic measurement errors (always weighing pigs in the afternoon when gut fill is higher) - Observer bias (subjective scoring)\nPrecision\nPrecision measures the repeatability of measurements—how close repeated measurements are to each other.\n\n\nHigh precision: Repeated measurements give similar results\n\nLow precision: Repeated measurements vary widely\n\nSources of imprecision: - Measurement error (animal movement during weighing, variable ultrasound probe placement) - Temporal variation (weighing at different times of day) - Observer variation (different technicians scoring the same animal differently)\nThe Target Analogy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Accuracy vs. precision illustrated as target shooting. In animal breeding, we strive for high accuracy and high precision (top-left quadrant).\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters in breeding:\n\nAccuracy: Biased measurements lead to biased EBVs and incorrect selection decisions. For example, if a scale always reads 5 kg too high, pigs weighed on that scale appear genetically superior when they’re not.\nPrecision: Imprecise measurements inflate the environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)), which reduces the effective heritability and slows genetic progress.\n\nGoal: Breeding programs strive for high accuracy and high precision—measurements that are both correct on average and repeatable.\n\n2.3.3 3.3 Challenges in Phenotyping Livestock\nAccurate phenotyping is often the most expensive and time-consuming aspect of a breeding program. Let’s explore the main challenges.\nCost\nModern phenotyping technologies can be prohibitively expensive:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\nPurpose\nApproximate Cost\n\n\n\n\nElectronic feeder (FIRE system, swine)\nIndividual feed intake\n$50,000-$100,000+ per pen (10-12 pigs)\n\n\n\nGrowSafe feeder (cattle)\nIndividual feed intake\n$60,000-$120,000 per pen\n\n\n\nAutomated milking system (dairy)\nMilk yield, components, health\n$150,000-$250,000 per robot\n\n\n\nUltrasound machine (carcass)\nBackfat, loin depth\n$15,000-$40,000\n\n\nCT/MRI scanner\nHigh-resolution carcass composition\n$500,000-$2,000,000+\n\n\nGenomic SNP chip\nGenotyping for genomic selection\n$30-$150 per animal\n\n\n\nTrade-off: Companies must balance the cost of phenotyping against the genetic gain achieved by having more accurate data. For example:\n\nInstalling electronic feeders to measure feed efficiency costs ~$5,000-8,000 per pig phenotyped\nBut selecting for RFI can save $2-4 per market pig in feed costs\nWith millions of market pigs produced annually, the investment pays off over time\nTime\nSome traits require months or years to measure:\n\n\nLongevity (dairy): Requires cows to complete multiple lactations (4-8 years)\n\nStayability (beef): Requires cows to reach age 6 and wean multiple calves\n\nFeed efficiency (RFI): Requires 8-12 weeks of daily intake records per animal\n\nCarcass traits: Require slaughter (can’t select the best animals—they’re dead!)\n\nSolution: Use correlated traits measured earlier or on relatives: - Ultrasound carcass traits on live animals (correlated with actual carcass) - Genomic selection (predict EBVs using DNA markers, no need to wait for phenotypes) - Progeny testing (measure trait on relatives, not the selection candidate)\nInvasiveness\nSome phenotypes require invasive or destructive procedures:\n\n\nCarcass traits: Require slaughter\n\nInternal organs: Require necropsy (research context, disease resistance studies)\n\nBlood samples: Immune assays, metabolic profiles\n\nBiopsies: Muscle samples for meat quality analysis\n\nInvasive phenotypes are often measured on a subset of animals (progeny, siblings), and their information is used to predict breeding values for the live selection candidates via genetic relationships.\nThroughput\nManual phenotyping is labor-intensive and limits the number of animals that can be measured:\n\n\nManual milk recording (dairy): Technician records each cow’s milk yield (slow, only monthly)\n\nTrap nests (layers): Manually identify which hen laid which egg (labor-intensive)\n\nCarcass dissection: Extremely time-consuming, limited to research settings\n\nSolution: Automation dramatically increases throughput: - Milking robots: Record every cow, every milking (2-3× per day) - RFID nest boxes: Automatically detect which hen enters each nest - Camera-based phenotyping: Automated body condition scoring, weight estimation (Chapter 25)\n\n2.3.4 3.4 Examples by Species\nLet’s explore how major livestock species phenotype their most important traits, highlighting the technologies and challenges involved.\nSwine Breeding\nGrowth traits (body weight, ADG): - Measurement: Electronic scales at entry to finishing barn and at market - Frequency: Initial weight (~25 kg), final weight (~110-130 kg) - Challenge: Pigs housed in groups, so individual weighing requires sorting - Automation: Walk-through scales, automated sorting gates\nFeed efficiency (RFI): - Measurement: FIRE (Feed Intake Recording Equipment) feeders - How it works: RFID ear tag identifies pig, feeder records feed disappearance each visit - Duration: 8-12 weeks of data collection per pig - Challenge: Expensive ($50K-100K per pen), requires careful management - Benefit: Individual feed intake enables direct selection for RFI (saves $2-3 per pig in feed costs)\nBackfat and loin depth (carcass quality): - Measurement: Real-time ultrasound at ~100 kg body weight - Location: Between 10th-11th rib (standard site) - Technician training: Requires skilled ultrasound operator - Accuracy: Correlation with carcass measurements: r ≈ 0.70-0.85\nLitter size (reproduction): - Measurement: Manual counting at farrowing (birth) - Timing: Within 24-48 hours of birth - Traits recorded: Total born, born alive, stillborn, mummified - Challenge: Requires accurate sow and piglet identification, 24/7 farrowing supervision\nDairy Cattle Breeding\nMilk yield: - Traditional (DHI testing): Monthly milk weights recorded by technician - Technician visits farm once per month - Weighs milk from each cow at one milking - Adjusted to 305-day lactation yield using standardized curves - Modern (automated milking systems - AMS): Milking robot records every milking - Each cow milked 2-3× per day voluntarily - Continuous data stream: yield, milking time, flow rate - More accurate estimates, enables selection for milking speed\nMilk components (fat%, protein%): - DHI testing: Lab analysis from monthly test-day samples - AMS: Inline sensors (near-infrared spectroscopy) measure components in real-time - Accuracy: Inline sensors slightly less accurate than lab but provide daily data\nFertility: - Traits: Days open (calving to conception), daughter pregnancy rate, first-service conception - Measurement: Breeding records, pregnancy checks (palpation, ultrasound) - Challenge: Requires accurate record-keeping of inseminations and calving dates\nHealth (mastitis, lameness): - Somatic cell count (SCC): Indicator of mastitis (elevated SCC = infection) - Measured from monthly DHI test-day samples - Also measured at bulk tank level (herd average) - Lameness: Locomotion scoring (1-5 scale), mobility assessments - Subjective, requires trained observer - Computer vision systems (Chapter 25) increasingly used for automated lameness detection\nPoultry Breeding (Broilers)\nBody weight: - Measurement: Group weighing (sample of birds from pen) or individual weighing - Age: Typically at 35-42 days (market age) - Challenge: Handling stress can affect weight; standardized protocols required\nFeed efficiency (FCR): - Measurement: Group level (pen) - Total feed consumed by pen ÷ total weight gain of pen - Limitation: Can’t measure individual bird feed intake in typical commercial housing - Genomic selection: Increasingly used to predict individual FCR using DNA markers\nCarcass traits (breast yield, leg yield, abdominal fat): - Measurement: Processing plant data (post-slaughter) - Selection challenge: Must select on family information (can’t measure on the selection candidate itself) - Modern: CT scans on live birds (research settings), genomic prediction\nLeg health: - Measurement: Gait scoring (0 = normal to 5 = severe lameness) - Challenge: Subjective, requires standardized scoring protocols - Economic importance: Lame birds have reduced welfare, lower growth, higher mortality\nPoultry Breeding (Layers)\nEgg production: - Traditional: Trap nests—hen enters nest, door closes, eggs collected and identified to hen - Labor-intensive, stressful for hens - Modern: RFID nest boxes—hen’s leg band automatically identified when entering nest - Automated recording, less stressful - Eggs per hen housed, persistency of lay\nEgg quality: - Egg weight: Automated inline scales as eggs move on conveyor - Shell strength: Deformation test, breaking force - Sample of eggs per hen, measured in lab - Shell color: Visual or automated color grading - Internal quality: Haugh units (albumin height relative to egg weight) - Sample of eggs broken and measured\nFeed efficiency: - Measurement: Feed per dozen eggs or feed per kg of egg mass - Challenge: Measuring individual feed intake is difficult in cage-free systems - Genomic selection: Enables selection for feed efficiency without expensive individual measurements\nBeef Cattle Breeding\nGrowth traits (weaning weight, yearling weight): - Measurement: Scales at weaning (~205 days) and yearling (~365 days) - Adjustments: Standardized to 205-day and 365-day weights using age-adjustment factors - Contemporary groups: Animals compared within herd-year-season groups\nCarcass traits: - Live animal ultrasound: Backfat, ribeye area, intramuscular fat (marbling) - Measured at ~365 days (yearling age) or pre-slaughter - Correlation with actual carcass: r ≈ 0.60-0.80 - Actual carcass data: From progeny or siblings sent to slaughter - Marbling score, yield grade, carcass weight, ribeye area - Most accurate but requires slaughter (can’t select the animal itself)\nFeed efficiency (RFI): - Measurement: GrowSafe feeders (individual feed intake in feedlot) - Challenge: Extremely expensive, limited to seedstock herds and research - Duration: 70-120 days of feed intake data per animal - Adoption: Low (~1-2% of beef industry), primarily genomic prediction used instead\nMaternal traits: - Measurement: Weaning weight of calves (maternal ability), calving ease scores, cow size - Challenge: Traits expressed only in females, requires multiple breeding seasons - EPDs: Maternal milk EPD, maternal calving ease EPD",

    "section": "\n2.4 Recording and Managing Data",
    "text": "2.4 Recording and Managing Data\nPhenotyping produces vast amounts of data—millions of records across thousands or millions of animals. This data is the lifeblood of a breeding program. Without systematic data recording, quality control, and management, even the best phenotyping technologies are useless.\nThis section covers the practical systems that enable breeding programs to collect, validate, store, and retrieve phenotypic data reliably.\n\n2.4.1 4.1 Animal Identification Systems\nBefore we can record a phenotype, we must know which animal it belongs to. Animal identification is therefore the first essential step in data management.\nVisual Identification\nEar tags: - Plastic or metal tags attached to the ear with unique numbers - Pros: Inexpensive ($0.50-$2 per tag), easy to apply, visible from distance - Cons: Can be lost, difficult to read when dirty, prone to fading, not suitable for automated data capture\nTattoos: - Permanent ink applied inside ear or on skin - Pros: Permanent, cannot be removed or lost - Cons: Hard to read without restraint, fades over time, requires good technique\nBranding: - Hot iron or freeze branding on hide - Pros: Permanent, visible from distance - Cons: Painful, damages hide (reduces carcass value), welfare concerns, increasingly discouraged\nSpecies-specific considerations: - Cattle: Visual ear tags most common, some brands still used in range cattle - Swine: Ear notching (historical, rare now), ear tags - Sheep: Ear tags, paint marks (temporary) - Poultry: Leg bands (layers), wing bands, no ID (broilers, group selection)\nElectronic Identification (RFID)\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) uses a microchip that transmits a unique ID when scanned by a reader.\nPassive RFID: - No battery: Powered by electromagnetic field from reader - Range: Short (typically &lt;1 meter) - Applications: Ear tags (cattle, swine), leg bands (poultry), injectable transponders - Cost: $2-$5 per tag\nActive RFID: - Battery powered: Transmits continuously or on schedule - Range: Longer (up to 100+ meters) - Applications: Location tracking, estrus detection collars (dairy) - Cost: $15-50+ per tag\nHow RFID works in breeding programs:\n\n\nAnimal approaches automated system (feeder, scale, milking robot, nest box)\n\nRFID reader detects tag and reads unique ID\n\nSystem records phenotype (feed intake, body weight, milk yield, egg) linked to that animal’s ID\n\nData automatically uploaded to database\n\nExample: Swine feed efficiency (RFI) - Each pig wears an RFID ear tag with unique ID - FIRE feeder reads tag when pig enters - Feed disappearance recorded for that specific pig - 8-12 weeks of data → calculate individual RFI - No manual recording required!\nBenefits: - Automation: Eliminates manual data entry (reduces errors) - High throughput: Thousands of records per day - Real-time data: Immediate upload to database - Accuracy: No transcription errors\nChallenges: - Tag loss: 1-5% of tags lost (animals lose ears in fights, tags fall out) - Misreads: Electronic interference, dirty tags - Cost: Higher initial investment than visual ID\nDNA-Based Parentage Verification\nEven with careful record-keeping, pedigree errors occur: - Incorrect sire recorded (wrong bull/boar used) - Dam mis-identified (piglet assigned to wrong sow) - Sample swaps in lab (genotype or phenotype mislabeled)\nPedigree errors bias breeding value estimates and reduce genetic gain.\nDNA parentage testing: - Microsatellite markers (historical) or SNP panels (modern) - Compare offspring genotype to putative parents - If genotypes incompatible → pedigree error detected\nWhen used: - Routine verification: Genotype all selection candidates and verify parentage (common in swine, poultry breeding companies) - Natural mating: Assign paternity when multiple sires per pen (beef, sheep) - Quality control: Detect sample swaps or recording errors\nCost-benefit: - Cost: ~$20-$50 per animal (using SNP chips that also provide genomic data) - Benefit: Correcting even 2-5% pedigree errors significantly improves EBV accuracy and genetic gain\n\n2.4.2 4.2 Data Entry and Validation\nEven with automated systems, human data entry is often required—especially for reproductive traits, health events, and management records.\nCommon Data Entry Errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Type\nExample\nImpact\n\n\n\nTransposed digits\nAnimal 1234 recorded as 1243\nPhenotype assigned to wrong animal\n\n\nWrong date\nBirth date entered as 2024-02-30 (impossible)\nInvalid record, breaks age calculations\n\n\nUnit errors\nWeight in pounds entered as kg (or vice versa)\nSeverely biased phenotype\n\n\nDecimal errors\n1.5 kg entered as 15 kg\nExtreme outlier\n\n\nSwapped IDs\nPhenotypes for animals A and B accidentally swapped\nBoth animals get wrong phenotypes\n\n\nMissing data\nRequired field left blank\nRecord unusable for analysis\n\n\nDuplicate records\nSame phenotype entered twice\nInflates sample size, biases estimates\n\n\nValidation Rules\nRange checks: - Birth weight must be within biologically plausible range (e.g., 0.5-2.5 kg for piglets) - Egg weight must be 40-80 g (anything outside → flag for review) - Milk yield per day &lt; 80 kg (higher values likely errors)\nDate sequence checks: - Birth date &lt; Weaning date &lt; Current date - Insemination date &lt; Calving date (and gestation ~280 days for cattle)\nID verification: - Animal ID must exist in database before phenotype can be entered - Parent IDs must exist if recording pedigree - No duplicate IDs\nLogical consistency: - Can’t have litter size of 0 (sow either farrowed or didn’t) - Can’t have male with lactation record\nImplementation: - Database constraints: Enforce rules at database level (prevent invalid entries) - Entry forms: Use dropdown menus, date pickers, range validators - Real-time feedback: Alert user immediately if entry violates rule\nTimeliness\nEnter data as soon as possible after collection: - Same day is best (memory fresh, fewer errors) - Delays lead to: Lost paper records, forgotten values, transcription errors\nDigital data capture: - Tablet or phone apps at point of measurement (enter directly into device) - Automated systems upload in real-time - Eliminates paper → digital transcription step (major source of errors)\n###4.3 Data Quality Control\nEven with validation rules, errors slip through. Quality control (QC) is the systematic process of identifying and correcting errors in existing data.\nOutlier Detection\nStatistical outliers are observations that are far from the population mean—they may be: 1. Real biological extremes (keep in dataset) 2. Measurement errors (investigate and correct or remove)\nCommon method: ±3 SD rule\n\nCalculate mean (\\(\\bar{y}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(s\\)) for a trait within contemporary group\n\nFlag values outside \\(\\bar{y} \\pm 3s\\)\n\nReview flagged records: Are they plausible? Or errors?\n\nExample (swine weaning weight): - Contemporary group: 100 piglets weaned at 21 days - Mean weight: \\(\\bar{y} = 6.2\\) kg - Standard deviation: \\(s = 0.8\\) kg - Flagging rule: Flag any piglet &lt; 3.8 kg or &gt; 8.6 kg\nSuppose one piglet shows 12.0 kg → Likely error (probably 1.2 kg entered as 12.0 kg). Investigate!\nImpossible Values\nSome errors are obvious: - Negative body weights - Birth date after measurement date - Litter size &gt; 25 piglets (biologically implausible) - Milk yield &gt; 100 kg/day (Holstein average is ~30-40 kg/day)\nAutomated checks can flag these for review.\nDuplicate Records\nSometimes the same phenotype is entered twice (e.g., technician forgot they already entered it): - Check for identical animal ID + trait + date + value - Remove duplicates (keep only one copy)\nMissing Data Patterns\nRandom missing data: A few animals missing records due to chance → usually not a problem\nSystematic missing data: Can bias genetic evaluations - Example: Only sick animals get health records → makes disease look more common than it is - Example: Smallest piglets not weighed (too small to handle) → inflates average weaning weight\nSolution: Ensure complete data collection for all animals in contemporary groups whenever possible.\n\n2.4.3 4.4 Database Structures (Brief Introduction)\nModern breeding programs store data in relational databases—systems that organize data into tables linked by keys.\nCore Tables\n1.

For now, the key takeaway: Structured data storage is essential for managing breeding program data at scale.",

    "section": "\n2.5 Breeding Objectives",
    "text": "2.5 Breeding Objectives\nWe’ve covered what traits exist (Section 2) and how to measure them (Sections 3-4). Now we address a critical strategic question: What should we actually select for?\nThis question defines the breeding objective (also called the breeding goal)—the traits we want to improve and their relative importance. Defining a clear breeding objective is essential because:\n\n\nResources are limited: We can’t measure everything on every animal\n\nTrade-offs exist: Some traits are genetically antagonistic (improving one worsens another)\n\nPriorities differ: Different production systems have different economic drivers\n\n\n2.5.1 5.1 Defining the Breeding Goal\nThe breeding goal should reflect the economic reality of the production system. Ask:\n\n\nWhat traits drive revenue? (milk sold, pigs weaned, eggs produced, carcass weight)\n\nWhat traits drive costs? (feed consumption, veterinary treatments, mortality, days to market)\n\nWhat are the constraints? (regulations, animal welfare standards, market demands, sustainability goals)\n\nFormal definition:\nThe breeding goal (H) is a linear combination of traits weighted by their economic importance:\n\\[H = v_1 \\cdot \\text{BV}_1 + v_2 \\cdot \\text{BV}_2 + \\cdots + v_n \\cdot \\text{BV}_n\\]\nWhere: - \\(H\\) = Aggregate breeding value (overall genetic merit) - \\(v_i\\) = Economic weight for trait \\(i\\) ($/unit improvement) - \\(\\text{BV}_i\\) = Breeding value for trait \\(i\\)\nWe’ll formalize this in Chapter 9 (Selection Index). For now, understand that economic weights determine how much we value improvement in each trait.\nExample (simplified dairy breeding goal):\n\\[H = 0.30 \\cdot \\text{Milk} + 2.50 \\cdot \\text{Fat kg} + 4.00 \\cdot \\text{Protein kg} - 3.00 \\cdot \\text{Days Open} + 8.00 \\cdot \\text{Productive Life}\\]\nThis says: - Each extra kg of milk is worth $0.30 - Each extra kg of fat is worth $2.50 - Each extra kg of protein is worth $4.00 - Each day reduction in days open is worth $3.00 - Each extra month of productive life is worth $8.00\n\n2.5.2 5.2 Single Trait vs. Multiple Trait Selection\nSingle Trait Selection\nSingle trait selection focuses on improving one trait, ignoring all others.\nWhen it’s appropriate: - Research context: Studying response to selection for a specific trait - Extreme scenarios: One trait dominates economic value (rare in commercial breeding)\nExample: Selecting only for egg production in layers - Benefit: Fast progress in egg numbers - Problem: Correlated traits may deteriorate: - Egg weight may decrease (negative genetic correlation) - Shell quality may decline - Feed efficiency may worsen - Mortality may increase (metabolic stress)\nResult: Short-term gain in eggs, long-term problems with profitability and welfare.\nMultiple Trait Selection\nMultiple trait selection simultaneously improves several traits, accounting for economic importance and genetic correlations.\nWhy it’s necessary: - Profitability depends on multiple traits, not just one - Genetic correlations mean selecting for one trait affects others - Balance is essential: Can’t maximize production at the expense of reproduction, health, or welfare\nApproach: - Selection index: Combine traits into single value (H) that predicts economic merit - Optimal weights: Account for economic values, heritabilities, and genetic correlations - Selection decision: Rank animals by index value, select the top percentage\nWe’ll develop selection index theory in Chapter 9.\n\n2.5.3 5.3 Economic Weights (Introduction)\nEconomic weights quantify the value of a one-unit genetic improvement in a trait, holding all other traits constant.\nFormal definition:\n\\[v_i = \\frac{\\partial \\text{Profit}}{\\partial \\text{BV}_i}\\]\nThis is the partial derivative of profit with respect to the breeding value for trait \\(i\\).\nIn plain language: If we could magically increase an animal’s breeding value for trait \\(i\\) by 1 unit (1 kg, 1 day, 1 egg, etc.), how much would lifetime profit change?\nExample (swine): - Economic weight for ADG: +$15 per 100 g/day improvement - Faster growth → fewer days to market → lower facility/labor costs → more turns per year - Economic weight for feed efficiency (RFI): -$30 per 0.1 kg/day improvement in RFI - Lower RFI (more efficient) → less feed consumed → major cost savings (feed = 60-70% of costs) - Economic weight for backfat: -$8 per 1 mm reduction - Leaner carcasses receive premium pricing\nDeriving economic weights: Economic weights are derived from profit equations that model the production system:\n\\[\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Costs}\\]\nFor swine: \\[\\text{Profit} = (\\text{Carcass Weight} \\times \\text{Price per kg}) - (\\text{Feed Cost} + \\text{Fixed Costs})\\]\nBy taking partial derivatives with respect to each trait’s breeding value, we get economic weights.\nWe’ll work through detailed examples in Chapter 9. For now, recognize that economic weights: - Differ by production system (dairy, beef, terminal swine vs. maternal swine) - Change over time (as market prices, costs, and regulations change) - Require careful analysis (not just guesswork!)\n\n2.5.4 5.4 Examples of Breeding Objectives by Species\nLet’s explore real-world breeding objectives for major livestock species. Notice how objectives differ by production role (maternal vs. terminal, milk vs. beef, etc.).\nDairy Cattle: Net Merit Index (NM$)\nPurpose: Maximize lifetime profit of a cow’s daughters\nTraits included (simplified; actual index has 20+ traits):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEconomic Weight\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\nMilk yield (kg)\n+$0.02-0.04 per kg\nRevenue from milk sales\n\n\nFat yield (kg)\n+$2.00-3.00 per kg\nComponent pricing (fat valued highly)\n\n\nProtein yield (kg)\n+$3.50-5.00 per kg\nComponent pricing (protein most valuable)\n\n\nProductive life (months)\n+$8-12 per month\nReduce replacement costs, more lactations\n\n\nDaughter pregnancy rate (%)\n+$15-25 per %\nReduce days open, more calves, lower breeding costs\n\n\nSomatic cell score\n-$50-80 per unit increase\nMastitis indicator; higher SCC = milk loss, treatments\n\n\nBody size composite\n-$1-3 per unit\nLarger cows eat more feed (maintenance cost)\n\n\n\nKey insights: - Components valued more than volume: Protein yield has ~100× higher weight than milk yield per unit - Fertility matters: Despite low heritability, fertility has high economic weight - Health is economically important: Mastitis resistance (low SCC) is highly valued - Size has negative weight: Bigger ≠ better (higher maintenance costs)\nHistorical shift: - Pre-2000: Selection focused almost exclusively on milk yield - Result: Milk production increased dramatically, but fertility, health, and longevity declined - Post-2000: Balanced selection via Net Merit → stabilized fertility and health while continuing milk yield progress\nSwine: Maternal vs. Terminal Lines\nSwine breeding programs maintain separate lines with different breeding objectives:\nMaternal Line Objective (Large White, Landrace):\nGoal: Maximize sow productivity and longevity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nNumber born alive (NBA)\nHigh\nMore piglets = more revenue\n\n\nPiglet survival to weaning\nHigh\nNo value if piglets die\n\n\nMaternal ability (milk production)\nHigh\nHeavier weaning weights\n\n\nLongevity\nHigh\nSows cost $200-300 to develop; need 4-6 parities to pay off\n\n\nFeed efficiency\nModerate\nImportant but less than reproduction\n\n\nGrowth rate\nLow\nMaternal gilts not slaughtered (growth less critical)\n\n\nCarcass leanness\nLow\nNot slaughtered for meat\n\n\n\nTerminal Sire Line Objective (Duroc, Pietrain):\nGoal: Maximize efficiency and carcass value of market offspring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nGrowth rate (ADG)\nHigh\nFaster to market = lower costs, more throughput\n\n\nFeed efficiency (RFI)\nVery High\nFeed costs dominate; RFI improvement = major savings\n\n\nCarcass leanness (low backfat)\nHigh\nLean carcasses receive premium\n\n\nLoin depth / muscle\nHigh\nMore saleable meat per carcass\n\n\nMeat quality (pH, color)\nModerate\nAffects consumer acceptance\n\n\nLitter size\nNone\nTerminal sires mated to F₁ females (sire’s litter size doesn’t matter for commercial production)\n\n\n\nWhy separate lines? - Trade-offs: Selection for extreme growth and leanness can reduce reproductive fitness - Crossbreeding: Maternal line gilts crossed with terminal sires → commercial pigs get both maternal advantages (from dam) and growth/carcass advantages (from sire)\nBroiler Chickens\nGoal: Fast, efficient growth to market weight with good carcass yield and acceptable leg health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nEconomic Weight Context\n\n\n\nBody weight at 42 days\nVery High\nMore meat sold per bird\n\n\nFeed conversion ratio (FCR)\nVery High\nFeed = 60-70% of costs\n\n\nBreast meat yield (%)\nHigh\nBreast is most valuable cut\n\n\nLeg health / soundness\nModerate\nWelfare concern; lame birds grow slower\n\n\nLivability (survival)\nHigh\nDead birds = total loss\n\n\nUniformity\nModerate\nEasier processing if birds similar size\n\n\n\nChallenge: Genetic correlation between growth and leg problems - Fast growth → heavier body weight → more stress on immature leg bones → higher lameness - Solution: Multi-trait selection index that balances growth with leg health\nIndustry progress: - 1950s: Broilers required 16-18 weeks to reach 2 kg, FCR ≈ 4.0 - 2020s: Broilers reach 2.6-2.8 kg in 6 weeks, FCR ≈ 1.6-1.8 - Genetic gain: ~60-80 g per year increase in body weight, ~0.02-0.03 improvement in FCR per year\nLaying Hens\nGoal: Maximize egg production with good egg quality and feed efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nEggs per hen housed\nVery High\nPrimary revenue source\n\n\nEgg weight\nHigh\nPremium for larger eggs (but not too large for cartons)\n\n\nShell strength\nHigh\n6-10% breakage rate; stronger shells = fewer cracks\n\n\nFeed efficiency\nHigh\nFeed cost per dozen eggs critical for profit\n\n\nPersistency of lay\nModerate\nMaintain production after peak\n\n\nLivability\nHigh\nMortality reduces eggs per hen housed\n\n\nFeather cover / pecking\nModerate\nWelfare and production issue\n\n\n\nTrade-off: Egg production vs. egg weight - Genetic correlation: r_A ≈ -0.2 to -0.4 (antagonistic) - Selecting for more eggs tends to reduce average egg weight - Solution: Include both in index with appropriate weights\nBeef Cattle: Terminal vs. Maternal\nLike swine, beef cattle breeding distinguishes terminal and maternal objectives.\nTerminal Sire Index (for bulls mated to produce slaughter calves):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait (EPD)\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nYearling weight\nHigh\nHeavier calves at sale\n\n\nCarcass weight\nHigh\nMore meat = more revenue\n\n\nMarbling score\nHigh\nPremium for Choice/Prime grades\n\n\nRibeye area\nHigh\nMore high-value cuts\n\n\nCalving ease (direct)\nModerate\nAvoid dystocia when bull used on heifers\n\n\nBirth weight\nNegative\nLower birth weight = easier calving\n\n\n\nMaternal Index (for replacement heifers and cows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait (EPD)\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nHeifer pregnancy rate\nHigh\nMust breed to be productive\n\n\nCalving ease (maternal)\nHigh\nCow must calve unassisted\n\n\nMilk (maternal milk EPD)\nModerate\nBetter milk = heavier weaning weights in calves\n\n\nStayability\nHigh\nCows that last 6+ years amortize development costs\n\n\nMature cow size\nNegative\nSmaller cows = lower feed costs (maintenance)\n\n\nDocility\nModerate\nCalm cows safer to handle",

    "section": "\n2.6 True Breeding Value (TBV)",
    "text": "2.6 True Breeding Value (TBV)\nWe’ve now covered traits, phenotyping, data management, and breeding objectives. But there’s one critical concept we haven’t yet defined: What exactly is it that we’re trying to select for?\nThe answer is the True Breeding Value (TBV)—the genetic merit of an animal as a parent. Understanding TBV is fundamental to everything that follows in this course.\n\n2.6.1 6.1 Definition of True Breeding Value\nTrue Breeding Value (TBV) is defined as:\n\nThe sum of the average effects of all alleles an individual carries, summed across all loci that affect a trait.\n\nMore precisely:\n\\[\\text{TBV} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i\\]\nWhere: - \\(n\\) = number of loci affecting the trait - \\(\\alpha_i\\) = average effect of the allele at locus \\(i\\) that the individual carries\nIn simpler terms: TBV represents twice the expected deviation of an animal’s offspring from the population mean, assuming the animal is mated to average individuals.\nWhy “twice”? Because an offspring receives half its genes from each parent. So if a parent’s TBV is +10 kg, its offspring will be +5 kg above average (on average), assuming the other parent is average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTBV vs. Phenotype: A Critical Distinction\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype (P): What we observe and measure on the animal itself\n\nTBV: The genetic value the animal passes to its offspring\n\nThese are not the same! An animal with a high phenotype may have: - High TBV (genetically superior) - Favorable environment (good pen, extra feed, optimal health) - Both\nOnly TBV is heritable—passed to offspring.\n\n\nExample: Two dairy cows, both producing 12,000 kg milk per lactation\n\n\nCow A: TBV = +500 kg, Environment = +500 kg → Phenotype = 12,000 kg\n\nCow B: TBV = +1,000 kg, Environment = 0 kg → Phenotype = 12,000 kg\n\nBoth cows produce the same milk, but Cow B is the superior breeding animal. Her daughters will average +500 kg more milk than Cow A’s daughters (each inherits half the dam’s TBV, plus half from the sire).\n\n2.6.2 6.2 Why TBV is Important\nTBV is the target of selection because:\n\n\nTBV is heritable: An animal passes (on average) half its TBV to each offspring\n\nTBV predicts offspring performance: Animals with high TBV produce superior offspring\n\nTBV breeds true: Unlike environmental effects, TBV is permanent and transmitted across generations\n\nTBV determines genetic progress: Selecting high-TBV parents creates cumulative genetic gain\n\nContrast with environmental effects:\n\n\nFavorable environment (best pen, extra nutrition, optimal health) improves an animal’s phenotype but doesn’t pass to offspring\n\n\nHigh TBV improves the animal’s phenotype and passes half to each offspring, creating permanent improvement\n\nThis is why we spend so much effort estimating TBV (Chapter 7) and designing selection programs to maximize genetic gain (Chapter 6).\n\n2.6.3 6.3 TBV is Unknown but Estimable\nHere’s the challenge: We can never observe TBV directly.\nTBV is a theoretical construct—the sum of effects of alleles we can’t see (unless we sequence the genome and know the effect of every variant, which we don’t). We only observe phenotypes, which are a mixture of genetics and environment:\n\\[P = \\text{TBV} + E\\]\n(We’ll formalize this more carefully in Chapter 3, partitioning genetics into additive, dominance, and epistatic components.)\nSo how do we estimate TBV?\nWe use information that is correlated with TBV:\n\n\nAnimal’s own phenotype: Imperfect (includes environmental effects), but informative\n\nCorrelation with TBV depends on heritability: \\(r = \\sqrt{h^2}\\)\n\n\n\n\nPedigree information: Parents, grandparents, siblings\n\nParents pass half their TBV to offspring\nFull sibs share 50% of genes, half-sibs share 25%\n\n\n\nProgeny performance: Offspring inherit half their parent’s TBV\n\nHighly informative, especially if many progeny measured\n\n\n\nGenomic information: DNA markers (SNPs) linked to causal genes\n\nCaptures Mendelian sampling variation (Chapter 13)\nEnables prediction at birth, before phenotypes available\n\n\n\nBy combining all this information using statistical models (BLUP, genomic BLUP), we produce Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs):\n\\[\\text{EBV} \\approx \\text{TBV}\\]\nEBVs are our best guess at an animal’s true genetic merit. The accuracy of the EBV depends on how much information we have:\n\n\nLow accuracy (r ≈ 0.30-0.50): Young animal, no progeny, no genomic data\n\nModerate accuracy (r ≈ 0.50-0.70): Own phenotype, pedigree, or genomic data\n\nHigh accuracy (r ≈ 0.80-0.95): Many progeny tested, or genomic data + extensive phenotyping\n\nWe’ll cover EBV estimation in detail in Chapter 7.\n\n2.6.4 6.4 Ranking Animals by TBV\nThe goal of selection is simple:\n\nRank animals by their TBV and select the top-ranked individuals as parents.\n\nIn practice, since we don’t know TBV, we:\n\n\nEstimate TBV using available information → produces EBVs\n\nRank animals by EBV (or by a selection index combining multiple EBVs)\n\nSelect the top percentage (e.g., top 10%, top 1%) as parents\n\nMate selected parents to produce the next generation\n\nRepeat the process, accumulating genetic gain over generations\n\nExample: Selecting replacement gilts in swine\nA breeding company evaluates 1,000 candidate gilts. For each gilt, they have: - Phenotypes: Growth rate, backfat, litter size of dam - Pedigree: Known parents, grandparents - Genomic data: Genotyped with 60K SNP chip\nThey run a genetic evaluation (BLUP + genomic prediction) to estimate EBVs for each trait, then compute a selection index combining traits with economic weights.\nResult: Each gilt gets a single index value (estimate of aggregate TBV, \\(H\\)).\nSelection: Top 100 gilts (10%) selected as replacement breeding stock.\nOutcome: The selected gilts have higher average TBV than the unselected gilts → next generation has higher genetic merit → genetic progress.\n\n2.6.5 6.5 Conceptual Diagram: Phenotype, TBV, and Environment\nLet’s visualize the relationship between phenotype, TBV, and environment for a hypothetical trait (e.g., body weight at 150 days in swine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Relationship between phenotype (P), true breeding value (TBV), and environment (E). Each animal’s phenotype is the sum of its TBV and environmental deviation. Selection aims to identify animals with high TBV.\n\n\n\n\nKey insights from the diagram:\n\n\nPhenotype is the sum of TBV and environment: Animals with identical phenotypes can have very different TBVs\n\nSelection on phenotype alone is imperfect: Some animals with high phenotypes have only moderate TBV (they benefited from favorable environments)\n\nGoal of genetic evaluation: Use all available information (own performance, relatives, genomic data) to separate TBV from environmental effects and rank animals accurately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThe Central Challenge of Animal Breeding\n\n\n\nWe want to select animals with high TBV, but we can only observe phenotypes (which include environmental effects).\nThe entire machinery of quantitative genetics—heritability, genetic correlations, BLUP, genomic selection—exists to solve this problem: How do we accurately estimate TBV from noisy phenotypic data?",

    "text": "2.8 Summary\nThis chapter laid the foundation for understanding what we select for in animal breeding and how we measure it. Let’s review the key concepts:\n\n2.8.1 Key Points\n1. Traits of Economic Importance\n\nLivestock traits fall into six categories: production, reproduction, health/fitness, efficiency, quality, and welfare\n\n\nHigh heritability traits (h² &gt; 0.40) respond quickly to selection: growth rate, carcass traits, egg weight\n\nLow heritability traits (h² &lt; 0.20) respond slowly: fertility, disease resistance, longevity\nEconomic importance ≠ heritability — some low-heritability traits (e.g., fertility) have huge economic impact\n\n2. Phenotypes and Phenotyping\n\n\nPhenotype = Genotype + Environment (P = G + E)\nHigh-quality phenotyping requires both accuracy (correct on average) and precision (repeatable)\n\nChallenges: Cost (electronic feeders $50K-100K+), time (longevity takes years), invasiveness (carcass traits require slaughter), throughput\n\nModern technologies enable automated, high-throughput phenotyping: RFID feeders, milking robots, ultrasound, computer vision\n\n3. Recording and Managing Data\n\n\nAnimal identification is essential: Visual ID (ear tags), electronic ID (RFID), DNA parentage verification\n\nData quality control prevents errors: Range checks, outlier detection, duplicate removal\n\nValidation rules catch errors at entry: Impossible dates, out-of-range values, missing required fields\n\nRelational databases organize data: Animals, Phenotypes, Genotypes tables linked by IDs\n\n4. Breeding Objectives\n\n\nBreeding objective (H) defines what traits to improve and their relative economic importance\n\nEconomic weights (v) quantify the value of one-unit genetic improvement in each trait\n\nSingle-trait selection is fast but ignores correlated traits and can cause problems\n\nMulti-trait selection (selection index) balances multiple traits, accounting for economic values and genetic correlations\n\nObjectives differ by species and production role: Maternal vs. terminal (swine, beef), milk vs. beef (cattle)\n\n5. True Breeding Value (TBV)\n\n\nTBV is the sum of average effects of an animal’s alleles—its genetic merit as a parent\n\n\nTBV is heritable: Animals pass (on average) half their TBV to each offspring\n\nTBV is unknown: We can never observe TBV directly, only phenotypes (P = TBV + E)\n\nEBVs are estimates of TBV: Combining own phenotype, relatives, pedigree, and genomic data using BLUP\n\nGoal of selection: Rank animals by TBV (or EBV) and select the top individuals as parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThe Foundation of Genetic Improvement\n\n\n\nHigh-quality phenotypes + accurate data management + clear breeding objectives = successful genetic improvement.\nWithout accurate phenotypes, genetic evaluations will be biased. Without good data management, phenotypes will be unreliable or unusable. Without clear breeding objectives, we won’t know what traits to improve or how to weight them.\nThis chapter’s concepts underpin everything that follows in this course.",

    "text": "2.9 Practice Problems\n\n2.9.1 Conceptual Questions\n1. Trait Classification\nClassify each of the following traits into one of the six categories (production, reproduction, health/fitness, efficiency, quality, welfare). Then indicate whether you expect the trait to have high (h² &gt; 0.40), moderate (h² = 0.20-0.40), or low (h² &lt; 0.20) heritability.\n\nMarbling score in beef cattle\nLitter size in swine\nFeed conversion ratio in broilers\nSomatic cell count (mastitis indicator) in dairy\nEgg shell strength in layers\nTemperament (docility) in beef cattle\n\n2. Phenotype vs. TBV\nTwo Holstein cows, Bessie and Daisy, both produce 11,500 kg of milk in their first lactation.\n\nBessie has an EBV of +400 kg for milk yield\nDaisy has an EBV of +800 kg for milk yield\n\n\nWhy might both cows have the same phenotype (11,500 kg) despite different EBVs?\nWhich cow would you prefer as a breeding animal? Why?\nIf both cows are bred to the same bull (EBV = +600 kg), what is the expected milk yield of their daughters (assuming population average = 10,000 kg)?\n\n3. Measurement Accuracy vs. Precision\nExplain the difference between accuracy and precision in phenotypic measurements. Provide an example of a measurement that could be:\n\nAccurate but imprecise\nPrecise but inaccurate\nBoth accurate and precise\n\nWhy does each property matter for genetic evaluation?\n4. Data Quality Control\nYou are reviewing weaning weight data for 100 piglets born in the same week. The mean weaning weight (21 days) is 6.2 kg with a standard deviation of 0.9 kg. Using the ±3 SD rule, you identify the following potential outliers:\n\nPiglet A: 12.5 kg\nPiglet B: 3.0 kg\nPiglet C: 9.1 kg\n\n\nFor each piglet, calculate whether it falls outside the ±3 SD range.\nFor each outlier, suggest two possible explanations (one biological, one data entry error).\nHow would you investigate to determine if the value is correct or an error?\n\n5. Breeding Objectives\nExplain why a swine breeding company maintains separate breeding objectives for maternal lines (Large White, Landrace) vs. terminal sire lines (Duroc, Pietrain). What traits are emphasized in each, and why?\n6. Contemporary Groups\nWhy is it important to account for contemporary group effects (e.g., pen, herd-year-season) when estimating breeding values? Provide an example showing how ignoring contemporary groups could lead to incorrect selection decisions.\n\n2.9.2 Quantitative Problems\n7. Heritability and Response\nBackfat depth in swine has a heritability of h² = 0.50, a phenotypic mean of 13 mm, and a phenotypic standard deviation of 2.5 mm.\n\nIf you select pigs with an average backfat of 10 mm as parents (3 mm below the mean), what is the expected selection differential (S)?\nWhat is the additive genetic standard deviation (σ_A)?\nUsing the simplified formula R = h² × S, what is the expected response to selection in the offspring generation?\n\n8. Economic Weights\nA swine breeding program estimates the following economic weights for a terminal sire index:\n\nAverage daily gain (ADG): +$15 per 100 g/day improvement\nResidual feed intake (RFI): -$30 per 0.1 kg/day improvement (negative RFI is better)\nBackfat depth: -$8 per 1 mm reduction\n\nTwo candidate boars have the following EBVs:\n\n\nBoar\nADG (g/day)\nRFI (kg/day)\nBackfat (mm)\n\n\n\nBoar A\n+50\n-0.15\n-1.0\n\n\nBoar B\n+30\n-0.25\n-1.5\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the index value (H) for each boar.\nWhich boar has superior genetic merit according to the index?\nExplain how genetic correlations between traits could influence which traits receive higher emphasis in the index (concept only, no calculations needed).\n\n9. Outlier Detection in R\nUsing the swine_data dataset from Demo 1 in this chapter, write R code to:\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of weaning_weight\n\nIdentify all animals with weaning_weight values outside the ±3 SD range\nCreate a histogram of weaning_weight with vertical lines showing the ±3 SD cutoffs\n\n(Hint: Adapt the code from Demo 3.)\n10. True Breeding Value Simulation\nIn the TBV conceptual diagram (Figure 6.5), we simulated a population where:\n\nTBV ~ N(100, 10²)\nEnvironment ~ N(0, 15²)\nPhenotype = TBV + Environment\n\n\nWhat is the heritability (h²) of this simulated trait?

    "section": "\n3.1 Introduction",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nImagine you’re visiting a commercial swine operation, standing in front of a finishing pen with 20 pigs that are all about 20 weeks old. You notice something immediately: these pigs aren’t all the same size. Some weigh 100 kg, others weigh 115 kg, and a few are pushing 125 kg. This variation raises a fundamental question that has driven animal breeding for centuries:\nWhy are these animals different from each other?\nMore specifically: Are the heavier pigs genetically superior, or did they just have better luck—better health, better access to feeders, or better pen mates that didn’t compete as aggressively for feed? If you’re selecting which animals to keep as breeding stock, this question isn’t just academic—it’s worth millions of dollars to a breeding company. Choose the wrong animals (those with good environments but poor genetics), and you’ll make little genetic progress. Choose the right ones (those with genuinely superior genetics), and you’ll steadily improve the herd, generation after generation.\nThe challenge is that we can only observe the phenotype—the animal’s actual weight, milk production, or growth rate. But what we really care about for breeding purposes is the animal’s genetic merit—the portion of its performance that will be transmitted to its offspring. We need a way to separate these two components.\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed how to measure phenotypes accurately and why high-quality data collection is essential. We introduced the concept of True Breeding Value (TBV)—an animal’s true genetic merit that determines what it passes to its offspring. But we didn’t yet address how phenotypes and breeding values relate to each other mathematically. That’s the purpose of this chapter.\n\n3.1.1 The Fundamental Genetic Model\nThe key insight that makes modern animal breeding possible is surprisingly simple: we can think of an animal’s phenotype as the sum of two components:\n\n\nGenetic effects: What the animal inherited from its parents\n\nEnvironmental effects: Everything else (nutrition, health, management, luck)\n\nMathematically, we express this as:\n\\[\ny = \\mu + A + E\n\\]\nThis equation—arguably the most important equation in all of animal breeding—says that an animal’s phenotype (\\(y\\)) equals the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) plus its genetic merit (\\(A\\), the additive genetic effect or breeding value) plus environmental influences (\\(E\\)).\nWhile this model looks simple, it has profound implications:\n\nIt explains why animals with the same genetics can have different phenotypes (different environments)\nIt explains why animals with the same phenotype can have different genetics (environment compensates or masks genetic differences)\nIt provides a framework for estimating breeding values from phenotypic data\nIt allows us to predict response to selection based on how much genetic variance exists in the population\n\n3.1.2 Not All Genetic Effects Are Equal\nHere’s where it gets more interesting: “genetic effects” aren’t a single, monolithic thing. When we look closely, we find that genetic effects can be partitioned into three types:\n\n\nAdditive effects (\\(A\\)): The effects that breed true and pass predictably from parent to offspring—these determine breeding value\n\nDominance effects (\\(D\\)): Within-locus interactions between alleles that don’t transmit reliably\n\nEpistatic effects (\\(I\\)): Between-locus interactions that are even more complex and unpredictable\n\nThe remarkable discovery that revolutionized animal breeding in the mid-20th century is that only additive effects matter for long-term genetic improvement. Dominance and epistasis can affect an individual animal’s performance, but they don’t breed true. When you select parents based on their phenotypes, only the additive portion of their genetic merit reliably appears in their offspring.\nThis is why we focus breeding programs on estimating and selecting for additive genetic effects—what we call breeding values. A bull with a high breeding value for milk production will tend to have daughters that produce a lot of milk, regardless of what dominance or epistatic effects happened to make the bull himself a high or low producer.\n\n3.1.3 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter\nIn this chapter, we’ll build a complete understanding of the basic genetic model that underlies all of quantitative genetics and animal breeding. Specifically, we’ll:\n\n\nDefine the model \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\) and understand what each component represents\n\nExplore the three types of genetic effects (additive, dominance, epistatic) and understand why they differ in importance\n\nLearn why additive effects are the primary focus of animal breeding programs\n\nPartition variance into genetic and environmental components, setting up the concept of heritability (Chapter 5)\n\nWork through numerical examples for multiple livestock species, showing how the model applies to real breeding scenarios\n\nUnderstand parent-offspring relationships and why offspring resemble their parents (but not perfectly)\n\nSimulate the model in R to visualize how genetic and environmental effects combine to create observed phenotypes\n\nThis chapter lays the foundation for everything that follows. Understanding how to partition phenotypes into genetic and environmental components is essential for:\n\nEstimating heritability (Chapter 5)\nPredicting response to selection (Chapter 6)\nUnderstanding genetic correlations between traits (Chapter 8)\nEstimating breeding values with BLUP (Chapter 7)\nAppreciating why genomic selection works (Chapter 13)\n\nThink of this chapter as learning the grammar of the language of quantitative genetics. Once you understand the basic model, the more complex topics in later chapters will make much more sense because they’re all extensions or applications of these fundamental ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA Note on Terminology\n\n\n\nYou’ll encounter several related terms in this chapter and throughout the book:\n\n\nBreeding value (BV) = Additive genetic effect (\\(A\\)) = Sum of additive effects of all an animal’s alleles\n\nTrue breeding value (TBV) = An animal’s actual, unknown breeding value (what we’re trying to estimate)\n\nEstimated breeding value (EBV) = Our statistical prediction of an animal’s TBV (covered in Chapter 7)\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably in practice, but the distinctions matter: TBV is the truth (unknown), EBV is our estimate (known but imperfect), and BV is the general concept.\n\n\nLet’s start by carefully defining each component of the basic genetic model.",

    "section": "\n3.2 The Basic Model: y = μ + A + E",
    "text": "3.2 The Basic Model: y = μ + A + E\nAt its heart, the basic genetic model describes how an individual animal’s observed performance (phenotype) is determined by the combination of its genetic merit and the environment it experienced. Let’s build this model carefully, starting with the conceptual idea and then moving to the mathematical representation.\n\n3.2.1 Conceptual Framework\nThink of an animal’s phenotype as the outcome of a “recipe” with three ingredients:\n\n\nThe species baseline: What’s typical for the population (e.g., the average weaning weight for pigs in this herd)\n\nThe animal’s unique genetics: Whether this particular animal inherited genes that make it grow faster or slower than average\n\nThe animal’s unique experiences: Whether it had good nutrition, stayed healthy, competed successfully for feed, etc.\n\nThese three components combine additively—they simply add together to produce the final phenotype. This is expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\ny = \\mu + A + E\n\\]\nThis equation is deceptively simple, but it encapsulates a profound insight: phenotype is the sum of nature (genetics) and nurture (environment). Let’s define each component precisely.\n\n3.2.2 Components of the Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNotation Guide: The Basic Model\n\n\n\n\\[y = \\mu + A + E\\]\n\n\n\\(y\\) (phenotype)\n\nThe observed measurement for an individual animal (e.g., 25.0 kg weaning weight, 12,000 kg milk production). This is what we can actually measure.\n\n\n\\(\\mu\\) (mu, population mean)\n\nThe average phenotypic value for the trait in the population. This represents the “baseline” performance expected for a random animal. Pronounced “mew.”\n\n\n\\(A\\) (additive genetic effect or breeding value)\n\nThe sum of the additive effects of all alleles that the animal carries. This is the animal’s breeding value—the genetic merit that determines what it will pass to offspring. \\(A\\) is expressed as a deviation from the population mean (can be positive or negative).\n\n\n\\(E\\) (environmental deviation)\n\nAll non-genetic influences on the phenotype, including nutrition, management, disease, microenvironment, measurement error, and random developmental variation. Also expressed as a deviation from zero (can be positive or negative).\n\n\nKey Assumption: \\(E(A) = 0\\) and \\(E(E) = 0\\) in the population (the expected values are zero)—meaning that on average, genetic and environmental deviations balance out. Individual animals deviate above or below the mean, but the population mean of these deviations is zero.\n\n\nLet’s be very clear about what these components represent:\n\n\\(y\\) is observable: We can weigh the pig, milk test the cow, or record the racing time. This is our data.\n\\(\\mu\\) is estimable: We can calculate the mean of all observations in a contemporary group (animals managed similarly).\n\\(A\\) is NOT directly observable: We cannot open up an animal and “see” its breeding value. This is the challenge of animal breeding—we must estimate \\(A\\) from phenotypic data and pedigree/genomic information (Chapter 7).\n\\(E\\) is NOT directly observable: For any individual animal, we can’t know exactly what environmental advantages or disadvantages it experienced.\n\nHowever, once we know \\(y\\) and \\(\\mu\\), we can calculate the phenotypic deviation:\n\\[\n(y - \\mu) = A + E\n\\]\nThe animal’s deviation from the population mean is due to the sum of its genetic merit and environmental effects. Our challenge as breeders is to separate these two components—to figure out how much of \\((y - \\mu)\\) is due to \\(A\\) (good genetics) versus \\(E\\) (good environment).\n\n3.2.3 Why This Model Matters\nThis simple model is the foundation of all modern animal breeding. Here’s why it’s so powerful:\n1. It explains variation between animals\nWhy is Pig #347 heavier than Pig #251? Three possibilities: - Pig #347 has better genetics (\\(A_{347} &gt; A_{251}\\)) - Pig #347 had a better environment (\\(E_{347} &gt; E_{251}\\)) - Some combination of both\n2. It provides a framework for estimating breeding values\nIf we can account for environmental effects (e.g., by comparing animals in the same pen, born in the same season), we can make informed guesses about their genetic merit. This is the basis for BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) in Chapter 7.\n3. It connects to response to selection\nWhen we select parents based on their phenotypes, the genetic progress we make depends on how accurately we’ve estimated \\(A\\). If phenotypic differences are mostly genetic (\\(A\\) is large relative to \\(E\\)), selection is effective. If differences are mostly environmental (\\(E\\) dominates), selection is less effective. This connects directly to heritability (Chapter 5).\n4. It generalizes to complex scenarios\nThis basic model can be extended to handle multiple traits, repeated measurements, maternal effects, and genomic information—but the core structure remains \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\).\n\n3.2.4 Example 1: Weaning Weight in Swine\nLet’s work through a concrete numerical example to make this model tangible. Consider weaning weight (measured at 21 days of age) in a population of piglets.\nPopulation parameters: - \\(\\mu = 6.0\\) kg (population mean weaning weight) - Typical range: 4.5 to 7.5 kg\nNow let’s look at three specific piglets and decompose their phenotypes:\nPiglet #1 (Heavy piglet) - Phenotype: \\(y_1 = 7.1\\) kg - Breeding value: \\(A_1 = +0.8\\) kg (genetically superior; 0.8 kg above average) - Environmental effect: \\(E_1 = +0.3\\) kg (slightly favorable environment) - Check: \\(y_1 = 6.0 + 0.8 + 0.3 = 7.1\\) kg ✓\nThis piglet is heavy (7.1 kg vs. mean of 6.0 kg) for two reasons: it has good genetics (+0.8 kg) and it had a slightly advantageous environment (+0.3 kg). Perhaps it had better access to the sow’s teats, or it avoided early disease.\nPiglet #2 (Above-average piglet) - Phenotype: \\(y_2 = 6.4\\) kg - Breeding value: \\(A_2 = -0.5\\) kg (genetically inferior; 0.5 kg below average) - Environmental effect: \\(E_2 = +0.9\\) kg (very favorable environment) - Check: \\(y_2 = 6.0 - 0.5 + 0.9 = 6.4\\) kg ✓\nThis piglet is above average phenotypically (6.4 kg vs. 6.0 kg), but it’s not genetically superior. In fact, it has below-average genetics (\\(A = -0.5\\) kg). Its above-average performance is entirely due to a very favorable environment (+0.9 kg). If we selected this animal as a parent based on phenotype alone, we’d be disappointed—its offspring would inherit the poor genetics, not the lucky environment.\nPiglet #3 (Light piglet) - Phenotype: \\(y_3 = 5.5\\) kg - Breeding value: \\(A_3 = +0.2\\) kg (genetically slightly above average!) - Environmental effect: \\(E_3 = -0.7\\) kg (unfavorable environment) - Check: \\(y_3 = 6.0 + 0.2 - 0.7 = 5.5\\) kg ✓\nThis piglet appears inferior phenotypically (5.5 kg, well below the mean). But here’s the surprising insight: it actually has positive genetic merit (\\(A = +0.2\\) kg). It’s light because it experienced a poor environment (−0.7 kg)—maybe it got sick, or was outcompeted by littermates. If we cull this animal based on phenotype alone, we’re discarding positive genetic merit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningThe Central Challenge of Animal Breeding\n\n\n\nWe can observe \\(y\\), but we need to know \\(A\\).\nPiglet #2 (y = 6.4 kg, A = −0.5 kg) looks better than Piglet #3 (y = 5.5 kg, A = +0.2 kg), but Piglet #3 is genetically superior. This example illustrates why animal breeding is not just about selecting animals with high phenotypes—it’s about estimating breeding values and selecting animals with high genetic merit, regardless of their environmental luck.\nThe better we can estimate \\(A\\) from observable data (\\(y\\), pedigree, genomics), the more genetic progress we make. This is why methods like BLUP (Chapter 7) and genomic selection (Chapter 13) are so valuable—they help us “see through” the environmental noise to the underlying genetic signal.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Example 2: Milk Yield in Dairy Cattle\nLet’s look at another species to reinforce the concept. Consider 305-day mature-equivalent milk yield in Holstein dairy cattle.\nPopulation parameters: - \\(\\mu = 10,000\\) kg (population mean) - Typical range: 7,000 to 13,000 kg\nCow #2417 - Phenotype: \\(y = 11,500\\) kg (high-producing cow) - Breeding value: \\(A = +1,200\\) kg (genetically superior) - Environmental effect: \\(E = +300\\) kg (good management) - Check: \\(y = 10,000 + 1,200 + 300 = 11,500\\) kg ✓\nThis cow is an excellent producer, and she’s genetically superior (+1,200 kg breeding value). If we use her as a dam, her daughters will inherit, on average, half of her breeding value (more on this in Section 3.7). We’d expect her daughters to have breeding values around \\(+1,200/2 = +600\\) kg, making them well above average.\nCow #1853 - Phenotype: \\(y = 11,200\\) kg (also high-producing) - Breeding value: \\(A = +400\\) kg (modestly above average) - Environmental effect: \\(E = +800\\) kg (exceptional management) - Check: \\(y = 10,000 + 400 + 800 = 11,200\\) kg ✓\nThis cow has a similar phenotype to Cow #2417 (11,200 vs. 11,500 kg), but she’s much less genetically valuable. Most of her high production is due to excellent management—perhaps she was in a herd with superior feeding, or she avoided health problems. If we breed her, her daughters will only inherit the +400 kg genetic component, not the +800 kg environmental advantage.\nCow #3692 - Phenotype: \\(y = 9,100\\) kg (below average) - Breeding value: \\(A = +600\\) kg (actually above average genetically!) - Environmental effect: \\(E = -1,500\\) kg (serious health or management problems) - Check: \\(y = 10,000 + 600 - 1,500 = 9,100\\) kg ✓\nThis cow produced only 9,100 kg—well below the herd average. A naive breeder might cull her. But she has positive genetic merit (+600 kg)! Her low production was due to severe environmental challenges (−1,500 kg)—perhaps she had mastitis, lameness, or poor nutrition. If we can identify her positive genetics (through pedigree information, progeny records, or genomic testing), she could be a valuable dam.\n\n3.2.6 Sources of Environmental Variation (\\(E\\))\nWhat exactly constitutes “environmental” effects? The \\(E\\) term is a catch-all for everything that’s not additive genetic. Major sources include:\nNutrition and management - Feed quality and quantity - Housing conditions (temperature, humidity, space) - Milking frequency (dairy) - Pen mates and social stress\nHealth - Infectious disease exposure - Parasite load - Immune status - Injury or lameness\nMicroenvironment - Birth order and colostrum intake - Maternal effects (quality of dam, not inherited by animal itself) - Random developmental variation (stochastic biological processes)\nMeasurement error - Scale calibration errors - Timing of measurement (e.g., dairy test day vs. full lactation) - Observer variation in subjective scores\nAge, parity, and season - Age at measurement (growing animals) - Lactation number (dairy cows produce more in later parities) - Season of birth (temperature, photoperiod, disease pressure)\nIn practice, we try to account for known environmental effects by using statistical models. For example:\n\n\nContemporary groups: Compare animals born in the same season, on the same farm, in the same pen\n\nFixed effects in BLUP: Adjust for known environmental factors like age, sex, parity\n\nEnvironmental covariates: Include feed intake, temperature, or other measurements in the model\n\nAfter accounting for these known effects, what remains in \\(E\\) is random, unpredictable variation—the “luck” each animal experienced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCommon Misconception: “Genetic vs. Environmental”\n\n\n\nStudents often misinterpret the model \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\) as saying that genetics and environment are competing forces, or that a trait can be “mostly genetic” or “mostly environmental.” This is a fundamental misunderstanding.\nCorrect interpretation: The model describes how genetics (\\(A\\)) and environment (\\(E\\)) both contribute to the phenotype. The question is not “Is this trait genetic or environmental?” but rather “How much of the variation in this trait across the population is due to genetic differences vs. environmental differences?”\n\nAll traits are influenced by both genes and environment\nThe relative importance of \\(A\\) vs. \\(E\\) determines heritability (Chapter 5)\nHigh heritability doesn’t mean environment is unimportant—it means genetic differences explain most of the variation in the population\n\nFor example, body weight in pigs is clearly influenced by both genetics (some pigs have genes for rapid growth) and environment (well-fed pigs grow faster). The model quantifies the relative contribution of each to explaining why pigs differ from each other.\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Assumptions of the Basic Model\nBefore we move on, let’s state the assumptions underlying this simple model:\n\nAdditivity: The genetic and environmental effects simply add together. There’s no interaction (genotype-by-environment interaction) where certain genotypes perform better in certain environments. (We’ll relax this assumption in advanced models.)\nIndependence: \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) are uncorrelated. The genetic merit of an animal doesn’t affect what environment it experiences. (This can be violated if we preferentially feed high-producing animals, creating covariance between \\(A\\) and \\(E\\).)\nNormally distributed effects: Both \\(A\\) and \\(E\\) follow normal distributions in the population. This assumption is reasonable for most quantitative traits and makes the math tractable.\nSingle environment: We’re assuming all animals are raised in reasonably similar environments that can be described by a single \\(E\\) term. If animals are raised in very different environments (e.g., grazing vs. confinement), we need more complex models with multiple environmental effects.\n\nThese assumptions are simplifications, but they work remarkably well for most practical breeding applications. As we progress through the book, we’ll see how to extend the model when these assumptions are violated.\n\n3.2.8 Summary of the Basic Model\nThe equation \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\) is elegant in its simplicity, yet powerful in its implications:\n\n\nPhenotypes (\\(y\\)) are observable; they’re what we measure\n\nPopulation mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is the baseline, estimable from data\n\nBreeding values (\\(A\\)) are the genetic merit we care about, but they’re hidden—we must estimate them\n\nEnvironmental effects (\\(E\\)) are everything else, also hidden\n\nThe fundamental challenge of animal breeding is to separate \\(A\\) from \\(E\\) so we can identify and select animals with superior genetic merit. The rest of this book is essentially about solving this challenge using progressively more sophisticated methods.\nIn the next section, we’ll dive deeper into the genetic component (\\(A\\)), exploring how it can be further partitioned into additive, dominance, and epistatic effects—and why only the additive portion matters for breeding.",

    "section": "\n3.3 Types of Genetic Effects",
    "text": "3.3 Types of Genetic Effects\nSo far, we’ve treated the genetic component of the model (\\(A\\)) as a single entity. But when we look more closely at how genes affect phenotypes, we discover that genetic effects can be partitioned into three fundamentally different types. Understanding these distinctions is critical because only one type—additive effects—determines what parents pass to their offspring.\nThe complete genetic value of an individual can be written as:\n\\[\nG = A + D + I\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(G\\) = Genotypic value (total genetic effect on phenotype) - \\(A\\) = Additive genetic effect (breeding value) - \\(D\\) = Dominance deviation (within-locus interaction) - \\(I\\) = Epistatic deviation (between-locus interaction)\nFor most practical breeding applications, we simplify the model by lumping \\(D\\) and \\(I\\) into the environmental term (\\(E\\)), giving us the basic model \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\). But to understand why we focus on \\(A\\), we need to understand what \\(D\\) and \\(I\\) represent and why they don’t breed true.\n\n3.3.1 Additive Genetic Effects (\\(A\\))\nDefinition: The additive genetic effect is the sum of the average effects of all alleles that an individual carries across all loci. It represents the portion of genetic value that is transmitted predictably from parent to offspring.\nConceptual Understanding\nThink of each allele as contributing a certain “dose” of effect to the phenotype, and these doses add up linearly:\n\nIf an animal inherits an allele that adds +2 kg to body weight, it gets +2 kg\nIf it inherits two such alleles (homozygous), it gets +4 kg\nIf it inherits one +2 kg allele and one −1 kg allele, it gets +1 kg total\n\nThe key property of additive effects is linearity: the effect of having two copies of an allele is exactly twice the effect of having one copy.\nSimple Single-Locus Example\nConsider a single gene affecting weaning weight in pigs with two alleles: - Allele \\(B\\) (beneficial): average effect of +1.0 kg - Allele \\(b\\) (less beneficial): average effect of −1.0 kg\nThe three possible genotypes and their additive genetic values:\n\n\nGenotype\nAdditive Value\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\\(BB\\)\n+2.0 kg\nTwo copies of beneficial allele\n\n\n\\(Bb\\)\n0.0 kg\nOne beneficial, one less beneficial (average)\n\n\n\\(bb\\)\n−2.0 kg\nTwo copies of less beneficial allele\n\n\n\nNotice the perfect linearity: the heterozygote (\\(Bb\\)) has exactly the average of the two homozygotes: \\((+2.0 + (-2.0)) / 2 = 0.0\\) kg.\nReality: Polygenic Traits\nIn practice, economically important traits in livestock are affected by thousands of genes, each with small additive effects. An animal’s breeding value is the sum of effects across all these loci:\n\\[\nA = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\n\\]\nWhere \\(a_i\\) is the additive effect at locus \\(i\\), and \\(n\\) is the total number of loci (typically thousands to tens of thousands for complex traits like growth rate or milk production).\nThis is why quantitative traits show continuous variation rather than discrete categories—the combined effect of many genes creates a smooth distribution of phenotypes.\nWhy Additive Effects Breed True\nHere’s the crucial insight: when an animal passes one of its two alleles at each locus to its offspring, the offspring inherits half of the parent’s additive genetic value, on average:\n\\[\nE(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam}\n\\]\n(Plus a deviation due to Mendelian sampling—the random sampling of parental alleles—covered in Section 3.7.)\nThis predictability is what makes selection work: if we choose parents with high breeding values, their offspring will tend to have high breeding values too.\n\n3.3.2 Dominance Effects (\\(D\\))\nDefinition: Dominance is a within-locus interaction where the heterozygote’s value differs from the average of the two homozygotes. Dominance effects represent deviations from additivity at individual genes.\nConceptual Understanding\nDominance occurs when alleles at the same locus interact such that having two different alleles (heterozygote) produces a phenotype that’s not exactly intermediate between the two homozygotes.\nThere are several types of dominance:\n\n\nComplete dominance: The heterozygote resembles one homozygote entirely\n\nPartial dominance: The heterozygote is closer to one homozygote but not identical\n\nOverdominance (rare): The heterozygote exceeds both homozygotes\nSingle-Locus Example with Dominance\nLet’s revisit the same gene affecting weaning weight, but now with dominance:\n\nAllele \\(B\\): beneficial\nAllele \\(b\\): less beneficial\n\nDominance: \\(B\\) is partially dominant over \\(b\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\nGenotypic Value\nAdditive Component\nDominance Deviation\n\n\n\n\\(BB\\)\n+2.5 kg\n+2.0 kg\n+0.5 kg\n\n\n\\(Bb\\)\n+1.5 kg\n0.0 kg\n+1.5 kg\n\n\n\\(bb\\)\n−2.0 kg\n−2.0 kg\n0.0 kg\n\n\n\nNotice that: - The additive component is the same as before (perfectly linear) - The dominance deviation captures how much each genotype deviates from additive expectation - The heterozygote \\(Bb\\) has a genotypic value (+1.5 kg) that’s better than the additive prediction (0.0 kg), thanks to dominance (+1.5 kg)\nIf we set \\(bb\\) as the reference (genotypic value = 0): - The average effect of substituting \\(b\\) with \\(B\\) is +2.25 kg (this determines the additive value) - But the heterozygote \\(Bb\\) gets a +1.5 kg “bonus” from dominance\nWhy Dominance Doesn’t Breed True\nHere’s the problem: dominance effects don’t transmit predictably to offspring. Let’s see why.\nConsider a \\(Bb\\) heterozygote pig with: - Additive value: \\(A = 0.0\\) kg (average of \\(BB\\) and \\(bb\\)) - Dominance deviation: \\(D = +1.5\\) kg - Genotypic value: \\(G = +1.5\\) kg (phenotypically superior)\nThis pig has a good phenotype (genotypic value of +1.5 kg) thanks to dominance. But when it reproduces:\n\nIt passes either \\(B\\) or \\(b\\) to each offspring (50% chance each)\nOffspring can be \\(BB\\), \\(Bb\\), or \\(bb\\) depending on the other parent\nThe dominance effect (+1.5 kg) only occurs in \\(Bb\\) offspring, not in \\(BB\\) or \\(bb\\) offspring\n\nIf this \\(Bb\\) pig is mated to a \\(bb\\) pig: - 50% of offspring are \\(Bb\\) (genotypic value +1.5 kg) - 50% of offspring are \\(bb\\) (genotypic value −2.0 kg) - Average offspring genotypic value: \\((+1.5 + (-2.0)) / 2 = -0.25\\) kg\nThe parent had a genotypic value of +1.5 kg, but the offspring average only −0.25 kg. The dominance effect was “lost” in the offspring that didn’t receive the \\(Bb\\) genotype.\nKey insight: Dominance is a property of the genotype (the combination of alleles), not the individual alleles. When alleles are passed to offspring and recombined with alleles from the other parent, the specific genotype (and its dominance effect) is not preserved.\nDominance in Practical Breeding\nFor purebred (within-line) selection, dominance effects are essentially noise—they make some animals phenotypically better or worse, but they don’t transmit predictably. We can’t select for dominance directly; it gets “shuffled” each generation during reproduction.\nHowever, dominance plays a crucial role in crossbreeding (Chapter 11). When we mate animals from two different breeds or lines, the crossbred offspring are heterozygous at many loci, and dominance effects across the genome combine to create heterosis (hybrid vigor). This is why crossbreeding is so effective for traits with low heritability, like reproduction and survival—traits where dominance effects are substantial.\n\n3.3.3 Epistatic Effects (\\(I\\))\nDefinition: Epistasis refers to between-locus interactions where the effect of an allele at one gene depends on which alleles are present at other genes. Epistatic effects represent deviations from additivity across multiple genes.\nConceptual Understanding\nWhile dominance is about how alleles interact within a locus, epistasis is about how alleles interact between loci. The phenotypic effect of a genotype at Gene A might depend on the genotype at Gene B.\nExamples of epistasis: - Complementary gene action: Two genes must both be “active” for a trait to be expressed - Suppressor genes: An allele at one locus masks the effect of alleles at another locus - Modifier genes: An allele at one locus enhances or diminishes the effect of another locus\nExample: Two-Locus Epistasis\nConsider two genes affecting muscle growth in beef cattle:\n\n\nGene 1 (Myostatin): Determines baseline muscle development\n\n\n\\(M\\) (normal), \\(m\\) (enhanced muscle)\n\n\n\nGene 2 (IGF-1, Insulin-like Growth Factor): Modifies the effect of Myostatin\n\n\n\\(I\\) (high IGF), \\(i\\) (low IGF)\n\n\n\nWithout epistasis, we’d expect the effects to add independently. With epistasis, the effect of having \\(mm\\) (myostatin mutation, double muscling) depends on the IGF-1 genotype:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype at Gene 1\nGenotype at Gene 2\nExpected (Additive)\nObserved (With Epistasis)\nEpistatic Deviation\n\n\n\n\\(MM\\)\n\\(II\\)\n0 kg\n0 kg\n0 kg\n\n\n\\(MM\\)\n\\(Ii\\)\n−1 kg\n−0.8 kg\n+0.2 kg\n\n\n\\(mm\\)\n\\(II\\)\n+8 kg\n+6 kg\n−2 kg\n\n\n\\(mm\\)\n\\(Ii\\)\n+7 kg\n+10 kg\n+3 kg\n\n\n\nIn this hypothetical example, the \\(mm\\) genotype (double muscling) provides a much larger benefit when combined with the heterozygous \\(Ii\\) genotype at IGF-1, due to a synergistic interaction between the two genes. This is epistasis: the effect of \\(mm\\) depends on the genetic background at Gene 2.\nWhy Epistasis Doesn’t Breed True\nLike dominance, epistasis depends on specific combinations of genotypes across multiple loci. When parents reproduce, their alleles are shuffled and recombined, breaking apart favorable (or unfavorable) epistatic combinations.\nConsider a bull with genotype \\(mmIi\\) that has exceptional muscle growth (+10 kg) due to the favorable epistatic interaction. When he reproduces:\n\nHe passes either \\(m\\) or \\(I\\)/\\(i\\) to offspring\nOffspring receive other alleles from the dam\nThe specific combination \\(mmIi\\) may not be recreated in offspring\nEpistatic effects are not reliably transmitted\n\nWith thousands of loci involved in quantitative traits, the number of possible epistatic interactions is astronomical (pairwise interactions alone: \\(n(n-1)/2\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of loci). These interactions are constantly reshuffled during reproduction, making them unpredictable and non-heritable in any simple sense.\nEpistasis in Practical Breeding\nLike dominance, epistasis affects individual phenotypes but doesn’t contribute to predictable response to selection. In practical breeding programs:\n\nFor purebred selection, we largely ignore epistasis—it’s absorbed into the environmental term or treated as random noise\nFor crossbreeding, epistasis (along with dominance) may contribute to heterosis, though dominance is thought to be the primary mechanism\nIn genomic selection (Chapter 13), some epistatic effects may be captured implicitly if favorable combinations happen to be in linkage disequilibrium with markers\n\nSome cutting-edge research explores explicitly modeling epistatic interactions using genomic data, but this is computationally challenging and not yet standard practice in livestock breeding.\n\n3.3.4 Genotypic Value vs. Breeding Value: A Crucial Distinction\nLet’s solidify the difference between an animal’s genotypic value (total genetic effect on its own phenotype) and its breeding value (what it transmits to offspring):\nGenotypic Value (\\(G\\)): \\[\nG = A + D + I\n\\]\nThis is the animal’s total genetic contribution to its own phenotype. It includes additive effects (breed true), dominance effects (specific to this individual’s genotype), and epistatic effects (specific to this individual’s combination of genotypes across loci).\nBreeding Value (\\(A\\)): \\[\nA = 2 \\times (\\text{expected value of offspring} - \\mu)\n\\]\nThis is twice the expected deviation of the animal’s offspring from the population mean (the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that each parent contributes half of the offspring’s breeding value). Breeding value includes only additive effects because only these transmit predictably.\nExample: Genotypic Value vs. Breeding Value\nConsider a boar with the following genetic effects for backfat thickness:\n\nAdditive genetic effect: \\(A = -2.0\\) mm (good—lower backfat is desirable)\nDominance deviation: \\(D = +0.8\\) mm (unfavorable dominance, increases backfat)\nEpistatic deviation: \\(I = -0.3\\) mm\n\nGenotypic value: \\(G = -2.0 + 0.8 - 0.3 = -1.5\\) mm\n\nBreeding value: \\(A = -2.0\\) mm (only the additive component!)\n\nThis boar’s phenotype (for the genetic component) is -1.5 mm (better than average, but not as good as his breeding value suggests, due to unfavorable dominance). However, when he’s used as a sire, his offspring will inherit an average of half his breeding value:\n\\[\nE(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-2.0) = -1.0 \\text{ mm}\n\\]\nThe offspring will not inherit the dominance and epistatic effects—those depend on the specific genotypes that form in the offspring.\nThis is why breeding programs estimate and select on breeding values, not phenotypes. The boar with \\(A = -2.0\\) mm is more valuable as a sire than a boar with the same phenotype but \\(A = -1.0\\) mm (whose good phenotype might be due to favorable dominance or environment).\n\n3.3.5 Comparison of Genetic Effect Types\nThe table below summarizes the key differences between additive, dominance, and epistatic effects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nAdditive (\\(A\\))\nDominance (\\(D\\))\nEpistatic (\\(I\\))\n\n\n\nDefinition\nSum of average effects of alleles\nWithin-locus interaction between alleles\nBetween-locus interactions\n\n\nTransmissibility\n✓ Transmitted predictably (50% from each parent)\n✗ Not reliably transmitted\n✗ Not reliably transmitted\n\n\nBreeds true?\n✓ Yes\n✗ No\n✗ No\n\n\nDetermines breeding value?\n✓ Yes\n✗ No\n✗ No\n\n\nContributes to response to selection?\n✓ Yes\n✗ No\n✗ No\n\n\nImportant for purebred selection?\n✓ Primary focus\n✗ Ignored (absorbed in \\(E\\))\n✗ Ignored (absorbed in \\(E\\))\n\n\nImportant for crossbreeding?\n✓ Yes\n✓ Yes (contributes to heterosis)\n✓ Possibly (contributes to heterosis)\n\n\nEstimated in breeding programs?\n✓ Yes (EBVs, GEBVs)\n✗ Usually not\n✗ Usually not\n\n\nVariance component symbol\n\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2_D\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2_I\\)\n\n\nExample traits with large effects\nAll quantitative traits\nLitter size, fitness traits\nUnknown (hard to measure)\n\n\n\n3.3.6 Why We Focus on Additive Effects in Animal Breeding\nThe reason modern animal breeding focuses almost exclusively on estimating and selecting based on additive genetic effects (breeding values) should now be clear:\n\nAdditive effects are the only genetic effects that transmit predictably to offspring\nResponse to selection depends on additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)), not total genetic variance\nBreeding values can be estimated from phenotypes, pedigree, and genomic data using statistical methods (Chapter 7)\nDominance and epistasis “wash out” over generations of selection—they don’t contribute to sustained genetic progress\n\nThis doesn’t mean dominance and epistasis are unimportant biologically—they affect individual phenotypes and can create substantial heterosis in crossbreeding. But for within-line selection to improve genetic merit, we focus on the additive component.\nIn the next section, we’ll explore this point further with concrete examples showing why additive effects are the engine of genetic improvement.",

    "section": "\n3.4 Why Focus on Additive Effects?",
    "text": "3.4 Why Focus on Additive Effects?\nWe’ve established that genetic effects can be partitioned into additive, dominance, and epistatic components. We’ve also seen that only additive effects transmit predictably to offspring. But why does this matter so much for practical breeding programs? Let’s explore this through concrete examples that illustrate the consequences of focusing (or not focusing) on additive effects.\n\n3.4.1 Predictability Across Generations\nThe fundamental reason we focus on additive effects is transgenerational predictability: if we select parents with high additive genetic values (breeding values), their offspring will, on average, have high breeding values too. This is not true for dominance or epistatic effects.\nMathematical Foundation\nRecall that offspring inherit one allele at each locus from each parent, chosen at random. This means:\n\\[\nA_{offspring} = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam} + \\text{Mendelian sampling deviation}\n\\]\nThe Mendelian sampling deviation represents random chance in which specific alleles were inherited, but on average across many offspring, it equals zero. So the expected breeding value of an offspring is:\n\\[\nE(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam}\n\\]\nThis beautiful linear relationship is the foundation of all animal breeding. If we know (or estimate) the breeding values of parents, we can predict the average breeding value of their offspring.\nIn contrast: - Dominance effects depend on which specific allele combination an offspring receives—unpredictable - Epistatic effects depend on complex interactions across multiple loci—even less predictable\nExample: Selecting for Growth Rate in Swine Over Three Generations\nLet’s trace the consequences of selection over three generations to see how additive effects compound while non-additive effects don’t.\nGeneration 1 (Parental generation)\nWe select two boars and two sows from a population with mean growth rate \\(\\mu = 750\\) g/day:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\nPhenotype\n\n\\(A\\) (BV)\n\\(D\\)\n\\(E\\)\nInterpretation\n\n\n\nBoar 1\n850 g/day\n+80 g/day\n+10 g/day\n+10 g/day\nGood genetics, slight dominance boost\n\n\nBoar 2\n830 g/day\n+50 g/day\n+15 g/day\n+15 g/day\nModerate genetics, more dominance and environment\n\n\nSow 1\n840 g/day\n+75 g/day\n+5 g/day\n+10 g/day\nGood genetics\n\n\nSow 2\n820 g/day\n+60 g/day\n+5 g/day\n+5 g/day\nDecent genetics\n\n\n\nIf we select based on phenotype alone (the naive approach), we’d prefer Boar 1 and Sow 1 (highest phenotypes). But let’s look at what happens to their offspring.\nGeneration 2 (Offspring)\nWe mate Boar 1 × Sow 1 and Boar 2 × Sow 2:\nOffspring from Boar 1 × Sow 1: - Expected breeding value: \\((80 + 75) / 2 = +77.5\\) g/day - Dominance: New genotype combinations—could be anything, but on average close to 0 for the offspring population - Environmental effect: Depends on management—assume average (0) - Expected phenotype: \\(750 + 77.5 + 0 + 0 \\approx 827.5\\) g/day\nOffspring from Boar 2 × Sow 2: - Expected breeding value: \\((50 + 60) / 2 = +55\\) g/day - Dominance and environment: Similar reasoning - Expected phenotype: \\(750 + 55 \\approx 805\\) g/day\nThe offspring from Boar 1 × Sow 1 are expected to be superior (827.5 vs. 805 g/day) because their parents had higher breeding values. The dominance effects in the parents (+10 and +5 g/day) did not reliably transmit—offspring have their own dominance effects based on their unique genotypes.\nGeneration 3 (Grandoffspring)\nNow suppose we continue selection, using the best offspring as parents for Generation 3. The offspring from Boar 1 × Sow 1 (expected \\(A \\approx +77.5\\) g/day) will produce Generation 3 offspring with expected breeding values around \\(+77.5\\) g/day (if mated to similar animals).\nOver generations, the additive effects compound: - Generation 1: Parents with \\(A \\approx +77.5\\) g/day (average) - Generation 2: Offspring with \\(A \\approx +77.5\\) g/day - Generation 3: Grandoffspring with \\(A \\approx +77.5\\) g/day\nThe genetic merit is preserved and can be further increased with continued selection. In contrast, the dominance effects “wash out”—Generation 2 offspring don’t inherit their parents’ dominance values, and Generation 3 offspring don’t either.\n\n3.4.2 Response to Selection Depends on Additive Variance\nOne of the most important equations in animal breeding is the breeder’s equation (covered in detail in Chapter 6):\n\\[\nR = h^2 \\times S\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(R\\) = Response to selection (change in population mean per generation) - \\(h^2\\) = Heritability (proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetics) - \\(S\\) = Selection differential (how much selected parents exceed the population mean)\nThe key insight is that heritability depends only on additive genetic variance:\n\\[\nh^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_A}{\\sigma^2_P}\n\\]\nDominance variance (\\(\\sigma^2_D\\)) and epistatic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_I\\)) do not contribute to response to selection. Even if a trait has substantial \\(\\sigma^2_D\\), that variance doesn’t lead to sustained genetic progress—it just creates “noise” that makes it harder to identify animals with high breeding values.\nThis is why traits with low heritability (like litter size in swine, where \\(h^2 \\approx 0.10\\)) are challenging to improve: there’s relatively little additive genetic variance relative to the total phenotypic variance. Most of the variation is environmental or non-additive genetic.\n\n3.4.3 Breeding Values Can Be Estimated\nA practical reason for focusing on additive effects is that we have statistical methods to estimate them from data. The field of quantitative genetics has developed sophisticated approaches—BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction), genomic selection, etc.—that estimate breeding values based on:\n\nAn animal’s own phenotype\nPhenotypes of relatives (parents, offspring, siblings)\nPedigree relationships\nGenomic information (SNP genotypes)\n\nThese methods work because additive effects follow predictable patterns of inheritance. We can use the covariance between relatives to infer breeding values. For example:\n\n\nParent-offspring covariance = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A\\)\n\n\nFull-sibling covariance = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A + \\frac{1}{4}\\sigma^2_D\\)\n\n\nHalf-sibling covariance = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\sigma^2_A\\)\n\n\nWe can’t easily separate out and estimate dominance effects for individual animals in most livestock populations (it would require enormous datasets and complex models). So we focus on what we can estimate reliably: breeding values.\n\n3.4.4 Example: Selecting Boars for a Swine Nucleus Herd\nLet’s make this concrete with a realistic breeding scenario. You’re managing a nucleus herd of swine, and you need to select 20 boars from 200 candidates to use as sires for the next generation. You have growth rate and backfat data on all candidates. Here are three candidates:\nBoar A - Phenotype: Growth rate = 950 g/day, backfat = 10 mm - Estimated breeding value (EBV): Growth = +150 g/day, backfat = −2 mm - Interpretation: Excellent phenotype, excellent genetics. Both traits are favorable (high growth, low backfat).\nBoar B - Phenotype: Growth rate = 980 g/day, backfat = 12 mm - Estimated breeding value (EBV): Growth = +80 g/day, backfat = +1 mm - Interpretation: Very high phenotype for growth, but only moderate genetics. His high growth is partly due to favorable environment or dominance. His backfat is actually slightly worse than average genetically.\nBoar C - Phenotype: Growth rate = 870 g/day, backfat = 9 mm - Estimated breeding value (EBV): Growth = +120 g/day, backfat = −3 mm - Interpretation: Moderate phenotype, but good genetics! He had an unfavorable environment (maybe illness early in life), so his phenotype underestimates his genetic merit.\nSelection decision:\nIf you select based on phenotype (naive approach), you’d rank them: Boar B &gt; Boar A &gt; Boar C.\nIf you select based on breeding values (correct approach), you’d rank them: Boar A &gt; Boar C &gt; Boar B.\nOutcome after one generation:\nSuppose each boar is mated to 10 sows with average breeding values (Growth \\(A = 0\\), Backfat \\(A = 0\\)):\nOffspring from Boar A: - Expected breeding value for growth: \\((+150 + 0) / 2 = +75\\) g/day - Expected breeding value for backfat: \\((−2 + 0) / 2 = −1\\) mm - These offspring will be excellent—well above population mean for both traits\nOffspring from Boar B: - Expected breeding value for growth: \\((+80 + 0) / 2 = +40\\) g/day - Expected breeding value for backfat: \\((+1 + 0) / 2 = +0.5\\) mm - These offspring will be only moderately above average—Boar B’s high phenotype was misleading\nOffspring from Boar C: - Expected breeding value for growth: \\((+120 + 0) / 2 = +60\\) g/day - Expected breeding value for backfat: \\((−3 + 0) / 2 = −1.5\\) mm - These offspring will be quite good—better than Boar B’s offspring despite Boar C’s lower phenotype\nThe lesson: Selecting on phenotype alone leads to slower genetic progress. Boar B looked great phenotypically, but his offspring are disappointing because his high phenotype was due to favorable environment or dominance, not superior breeding value. Boar C looked mediocre, but his offspring are excellent because his genetics are strong—his poor phenotype was due to bad luck.\nThis is why modern breeding programs invest heavily in estimating breeding values (through BLUP, genomic selection, etc.) rather than just selecting animals with the best phenotypes. The goal is to “see through” the environmental and dominance noise to identify the truly superior genetics.\n\n3.4.5 Dominance Matters for Crossbreeding, Not Purebred Selection\nIt’s important to clarify: we’re not saying dominance effects are biologically unimportant. They exist, and they matter—but they matter for crossbreeding, not for purebred selection.\nPurebred selection (within-line selection): - Goal: Improve additive genetic merit within a single breed or line - Method: Estimate breeding values, select parents with high EBVs - Result: Steady genetic progress generation after generation - Dominance: Ignored (absorbed into residual variation)\nCrossbreeding (mating animals from different lines/breeds): - Goal: Exploit heterosis (hybrid vigor) in commercial production - Method: Cross genetically distinct lines (e.g., Large White × Landrace sows mated to Duroc terminal sires in swine) - Result: Crossbred offspring have higher fitness (litter size, survival, growth) due to dominance effects across many loci - Dominance: Very important! Drives heterosis.\nThe key distinction: - In purebred populations, animals are relatively similar genetically, so there’s limited heterozygosity and dominance effects average out - In crossbreeding, animals from divergent populations are mated, creating extensive heterozygosity and substantial dominance effects\nWe’ll cover this in depth in Chapter 11 (Crossbreeding and Heterosis). For now, the takeaway is: within-line selection focuses on additive effects; crossbreeding exploits dominance effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHeterosis: The Exception That Proves the Rule\n\n\n\nYou might wonder: if dominance doesn’t breed true, how can we reliably exploit heterosis through crossbreeding?\nThe answer: We don’t try to select for heterosis within a population. Instead, we:\n\n\nSelect within purebred lines to maximize additive genetic merit (breeding values)\n\nCross the improved purebred lines to produce commercial animals that benefit from both:\n\nHigh additive genetic merit (inherited from purebred parents)\nHeterosis (dominance effects due to increased heterozygosity in crossbreds)\n\n\n\nThis is why commercial swine and poultry production uses elaborate crossbreeding systems: - Nucleus level: Purebred selection to improve additive genetic merit - Commercial level: Crossbreeding to exploit heterosis\nThe breeding companies capture genetic progress in the purebred nucleus herds (additive effects), then deliver that progress plus hybrid vigor to commercial producers (additive + dominance effects in crossbreds).\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Summary: Why Additive Effects Are Central to Animal Breeding\nTo summarize this section:\n\nAdditive effects transmit predictably from parents to offspring (\\(E(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam}\\)), while dominance and epistasis do not.\nGenetic progress depends on additive variance (\\(R = h^2 \\times S\\), where \\(h^2 = \\sigma^2_A / \\sigma^2_P\\)), not total genetic variance.\nWe can estimate breeding values using phenotypes, pedigree, and genomics—but we cannot reliably estimate dominance or epistatic effects for individual animals in most livestock populations.\nSustained improvement requires selecting on breeding values, not phenotypes. Animals with high phenotypes due to favorable environments or dominance will produce disappointing offspring.\nDominance effects matter for crossbreeding, where they create heterosis, but not for within-line selection.\n\nThe next section will shift from individual genetic effects to variance components—how we quantify the relative contributions of additive, dominance, and environmental effects to variation across a population. This will set us up for understanding heritability in Chapter 5.",

    "text": "3.5 Variance Partitioning\nSo far, we’ve focused on the genetic model for individual animals—how a single animal’s phenotype is determined by \\(\\mu + A + E\\). Now we shift perspective to the population level, asking: how much of the variation between animals is due to genetic differences versus environmental differences?\nThis shift from individual values to population variances is crucial because it connects directly to two fundamental concepts in animal breeding:\n\n\nHeritability (Chapter 5): The proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetics\n\nResponse to selection (Chapter 6): Genetic progress depends on the amount of additive genetic variance in the population\n\n\n3.5.1 From Individual Effects to Population Variances\nRecall the model for an individual:\n\\[\ny = \\mu + A + E\n\\]\nNow consider a population of animals. Each animal has its own \\(A\\) value (breeding value) and its own \\(E\\) value (environmental deviation). Across the population:\n\nSome animals have \\(A &gt; 0\\) (genetically superior)\nSome animals have \\(A &lt; 0\\) (genetically inferior)\nSome animals have \\(E &gt; 0\\) (favorable environments)\nSome animals have \\(E &lt; 0\\) (unfavorable environments)\n\nThe variance of phenotypes in the population (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)) quantifies how much animals differ from each other. This variance can be partitioned into components based on the sources of variation:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_D + \\sigma^2_I + \\sigma^2_E\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) = Phenotypic variance (total variation in phenotypes) - \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) = Additive genetic variance (variation due to breeding values) - \\(\\sigma^2_D\\) = Dominance variance (variation due to dominance effects) - \\(\\sigma^2_I\\) = Epistatic variance (variation due to epistatic effects) - \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) = Environmental variance (variation due to environmental effects)\nThis equation assumes: - Independence between components (no covariance between \\(A\\), \\(D\\), \\(I\\), and \\(E\\)) - Additive combination of effects (no genotype-by-environment interaction)\nIn practice, we often simplify this to:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_E\n\\]\nWhere we lump \\(\\sigma^2_D\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_I\\) into \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) (treating them as random, non-heritable variation). This simplification is justified because:\n\nDominance and epistatic variances are difficult to estimate (require large datasets and complex models)\nThey don’t contribute to response to selection\nFor most traits, \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) account for the vast majority of \\(\\sigma^2_P\\)\n\n\n3.5.2 The Variance Equation Explained\nLet’s unpack what each variance component represents:\nPhenotypic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)): - Measures how much animals differ from each other in observable performance - Calculated as the variance of phenotypes: \\(\\sigma^2_P = \\text{Var}(y) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\\) - Large \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) = animals are highly variable (some very high, some very low) - Small \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) = animals are similar (all close to the mean)\nAdditive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)): - Measures how much animals differ due to differences in breeding values - \\(\\sigma^2_A = \\text{Var}(A) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(A_i - \\bar{A})^2\\) (but we can’t directly observe \\(A\\)!) - Large \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) = substantial genetic diversity in the population (good for selection response) - Small \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) = limited genetic diversity (selection has less to work with)\nEnvironmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)): - Measures how much animals differ due to environmental effects (plus non-additive genetic effects if we’re lumping those in) - \\(\\sigma^2_E = \\text{Var}(E)\\) - Large \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) = environments vary widely, or measurement error is high - Small \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) = environments are uniform, phenotypes accurately reflect genetics\n\n3.5.3 Why Variance Partitioning Matters\nThe relative magnitudes of \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) determine how effectively we can improve a trait through selection:\n\n\nHigh \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) relative to \\(\\sigma^2_P\\): Most variation is genetic → phenotypes are good indicators of breeding values → selection is effective\n\nLow \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) relative to \\(\\sigma^2_P\\): Most variation is environmental → phenotypes are poor indicators of breeding values → selection is challenging\n\nThis ratio is called heritability, which we’ll define precisely in Chapter 5:\n\\[\nh^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_A}{\\sigma^2_P}\n\\]\nBut even now, we can see that estimating variance components is crucial for predicting response to selection and designing breeding programs.\n\n3.5.4 Example 1: Backfat Depth in Swine (High Heritability)\nConsider backfat thickness (measured at the 10th rib) in a population of finishing pigs.\nObserved data: - Mean backfat: \\(\\mu = 12\\) mm - Phenotypic standard deviation: \\(\\sigma_P = 3\\) mm - Phenotypic variance: \\(\\sigma^2_P = 9\\) mm²\nEstimated variance components (from genetic evaluation): - Additive genetic variance: \\(\\sigma^2_A = 5.4\\) mm² - Environmental variance: \\(\\sigma^2_E = 3.6\\) mm² - Check: \\(\\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_E = 5.4 + 3.6 = 9.0\\) mm² = \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) ✓\nProportion of variance: - Additive genetic: \\(5.4 / 9.0 = 60\\%\\) of total variance - Environmental: \\(3.6 / 9.0 = 40\\%\\) of total variance\nInterpretation:\n\n\n60% of the variation in backfat thickness between pigs is due to genetic differences (differences in breeding values)\n\n40% of the variation is due to environmental differences (nutrition, health, pen effects, measurement error)\nThis is a high heritability trait (\\(h^2 = 0.60\\))\n\nImplications for breeding: - Phenotype is a good indicator of genetic merit—pigs with low backfat likely have good genetics - Selection will be effective—we can make rapid genetic progress by selecting pigs with low backfat - Even moderate selection intensity will produce substantial response\nConcrete example:\nConsider two pigs with different backfat measurements:\nPig A: \\(y_A = 9\\) mm (3 mm below mean) - Expected breeding value (rough estimate): \\(A_A \\approx h^2 \\times (y_A - \\mu) = 0.60 \\times (9 - 12) = -1.8\\) mm - Expected environmental effect: \\(E_A \\approx y_A - \\mu - A_A = -3 - (-1.8) = -1.2\\) mm\nPig B: \\(y_B = 15\\) mm (3 mm above mean) - Expected breeding value: \\(A_B \\approx 0.60 \\times (15 - 12) = +1.8\\) mm (genetically unfavorable) - Expected environmental effect: \\(E_B \\approx 3 - 1.8 = +1.2\\) mm\nWith high heritability, most of Pig A’s low backfat (favorable) is due to good genetics (−1.8 mm), and we can confidently select it as a parent. Pig B’s high backfat is mostly genetic (+1.8 mm), so we’d avoid using it for breeding.\n\n3.5.5 Example 2: Litter Size in Swine (Low Heritability)\nNow consider number of piglets born alive (NBA) in sows.\nObserved data: - Mean litter size: \\(\\mu = 12\\) piglets - Phenotypic standard deviation: \\(\\sigma_P = 2.5\\) piglets - Phenotypic variance: \\(\\sigma^2_P = 6.25\\) piglets²\nEstimated variance components: - Additive genetic variance: \\(\\sigma^2_A = 0.75\\) piglets² - Environmental variance: \\(\\sigma^2_E = 5.50\\) piglets² - Check: \\(\\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_E = 0.75 + 5.50 = 6.25\\) piglets² = \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) ✓\nProportion of variance: - Additive genetic: \\(0.75 / 6.25 = 12\\%\\) of total variance - Environmental: \\(5.50 / 6.25 = 88\\%\\) of total variance\nInterpretation:\n\n\nOnly 12% of the variation in litter size is due to genetic differences\n\n88% of the variation is due to environmental factors (sow nutrition, health, age, season, service management, random biological variation)\nThis is a low heritability trait (\\(h^2 = 0.12\\))\n\nImplications for breeding: - Phenotype is a poor indicator of genetic merit—a sow with a large litter might just have been lucky - Selection will be slow—genetic progress is challenging because most variation is environmental - Need extensive data (multiple litter records, progeny testing) to accurately estimate breeding values\nConcrete example:\nConsider two sows with different first-parity litter sizes:\nSow A: \\(y_A = 15\\) piglets (3 above mean) - Expected breeding value: \\(A_A \\approx 0.12 \\times (15 - 12) = +0.36\\) piglets - Expected environmental effect: \\(E_A \\approx 3 - 0.36 = +2.64\\) piglets\nSow B: \\(y_B = 9\\) piglets (3 below mean) - Expected breeding value: \\(A_B \\approx 0.12 \\times (9 - 12) = -0.36\\) piglets - Expected environmental effect: \\(E_B \\approx -3 - (-0.36) = -2.64\\) piglets\nWith low heritability, Sow A’s large litter is mostly due to environment (+2.64 piglets luck), not genetics (+0.36 piglets). If we select her based on this single record, we’ll be disappointed—her daughters will inherit only the small genetic component, not the environmental luck.\nThis is why breeding companies record many litters per sow (genetic evaluations use 3–5 litter records when available) and rely heavily on pedigree information and progeny testing for lowly heritable traits. Genomic selection (Chapter 13) has been particularly valuable for litter size, allowing more accurate predictions even in young, unproven animals.\n\n3.5.6 Comparing Variance Components Across Traits\nThe relative magnitudes of \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) vary dramatically across traits. Here’s a comprehensive table showing typical variance components for important livestock traits:\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Typical variance components for economically important traits across livestock species.

Production and carcass traits generally have moderate to high heritability - Growth rate, body weight, carcass composition, egg weight: \\(h^2 = 0.30\\) to \\(0.60\\) - These traits respond well to selection - Phenotype is a reasonably good indicator of genetic merit\n2. Reproductive and fitness traits have low heritability - Litter size, fertility, survival, disease resistance: \\(h^2 = 0.05\\) to \\(0.15\\) - These traits are challenging to improve through selection - Require extensive data and sophisticated breeding value estimation - Genomic selection (Chapter 13) has been particularly valuable for these traits\n3. Milk and egg production are intermediate - Milk yield, egg production: \\(h^2 = 0.25\\) to \\(0.35\\) - Substantial genetic variation, but also substantial environmental influence - Selection is moderately effective\n4. Feed efficiency traits are moderately heritable - Feed conversion, residual feed intake: \\(h^2 = 0.25\\) to \\(0.40\\) - Historically difficult to improve due to expensive phenotyping - Precision livestock farming (Chapter 23) now enables automated feed intake recording\n\n3.5.8 Variance is Population-Specific\nA crucial caveat: variance components and heritability are properties of populations, not traits. The same trait measured in two different populations can have different \\(\\sigma^2_A\\), \\(\\sigma^2_E\\), and \\(h^2\\) values.\nFactors affecting variance components:\nAdditive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)) depends on: - Allele frequencies: \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) is maximized when allele frequencies are near 0.50 (high diversity) - Selection history: Long-term selection reduces \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) as favorable alleles approach fixation - Population size: Small, inbred populations have less \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) than large, diverse populations - Mutation and migration: Introduce new variation\nEnvironmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)) depends on: - Uniformity of management: Intensive systems (e.g., commercial poultry) have low \\(\\sigma^2_E\\); extensive systems (e.g., range beef) have high \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) - Measurement precision: Automated systems reduce measurement error, lowering \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) - Data quality: Accurate contemporary grouping and fixed effect modeling reduce residual \\(\\sigma^2_E\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCommon Misconception: Heritability Is Not “Genetic vs. Environmental Determination”\n\n\n\nStudents often misinterpret heritability as describing the relative importance of genes vs. environment for individual trait expression. This is incorrect.\nWrong interpretation: “Backfat has \\(h^2 = 0.60\\), so 60% of a pig’s backfat is determined by genetics and 40% by environment.”\nCorrect interpretation: “60% of the variation in backfat among pigs in this population is due to differences in breeding values, and 40% is due to environmental differences.”\nThe distinction matters: - All pigs need both genes and environment to develop backfat - Heritability describes why pigs differ, not how individuals develop - Heritability can change if the population or environment changes (e.g., more uniform management reduces \\(\\sigma^2_E\\), increasing \\(h^2\\) even though genetics haven’t changed)\nExample: Human height has \\(h^2 \\approx 0.80\\) in developed countries with good nutrition. This doesn’t mean “80% of your height is genetic”—it means that in these populations with relatively uniform nutrition, most of the variation between people is due to genetic differences. In a population with severe malnutrition variability, \\(h^2\\) could be much lower because environmental differences would dominate.\n\n\n\n3.5.9 Visualizing Variance Components\nTo help visualize the partition of phenotypic variance, imagine phenotypic variation as a “pie” that can be sliced into genetic and environmental portions:\nHigh heritability trait (backfat, \\(h^2 = 0.60\\)): - Large genetic slice (60%) - Smaller environmental slice (40%) - Selection is effective—most phenotypic differences reflect genetic differences\nLow heritability trait (litter size, \\(h^2 = 0.12\\)): - Small genetic slice (12%) - Large environmental slice (88%) - Selection is challenging—phenotypic differences mostly reflect environmental luck\nWe’ll create visualizations of these concepts in the R Demonstration section (Section 3.8).\n\n3.5.10 Summary of Variance Partitioning\nThe key insights from this section:\n\nPhenotypic variance can be partitioned into additive genetic, dominance, epistatic, and environmental components\nFor practical breeding, we often use the simplified model: \\(\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_E\\)\nHigh \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) relative to \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) → high heritability → effective selection\nLow \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) relative to \\(\\sigma^2_P\\) → low heritability → slow genetic progress\nVariance components are population-specific, not universal properties of traits\nDifferent traits have vastly different variance component structures, requiring different breeding strategies\n\nIn the next section, we’ll work through detailed examples showing how the genetic model applies to specific traits in multiple livestock species.",

    "text": "3.6 Examples Across Species\nTo solidify your understanding of the basic genetic model, let’s work through detailed examples from different livestock species. These examples show how the model \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\) applies to real breeding scenarios and how variance components inform breeding decisions.\n\n3.6.1 Example 1: Milk Yield in Holstein Dairy Cattle\nTrait: 305-day mature-equivalent milk yield (kg) Population: US Holstein dairy cattle\nPopulation parameters: - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)): 10,500 kg - Phenotypic SD (\\(\\sigma_P\\)): 1,500 kg - Phenotypic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)): 2,250,000 kg² - Additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)): 675,000 kg² - Environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)): 1,575,000 kg² - Heritability (\\(h^2\\)): 0.30\nThree cows from the same herd:\nCow #4217 (High producer) - Phenotype: \\(y = 13,200\\) kg - True breeding value (unknown to breeder): \\(A = +2,100\\) kg - Environmental deviation: \\(E = +600\\) kg - Check: \\(y = 10,500 + 2,100 + 600 = 13,200\\) kg ✓\nThis cow is a genuinely superior genetic animal (\\(A = +2,100\\) kg), and she also experienced favorable conditions (+600 kg), perhaps due to excellent feed quality and staying healthy throughout lactation.\nCow #5831 (Moderate producer) - Phenotype: \\(y = 11,400\\) kg - True breeding value: \\(A = +1,800\\) kg (actually better genetics than Cow #4217 phenotypically suggests!) - Environmental deviation: \\(E = -900\\) kg (unfavorable conditions) - Check: \\(y = 10,500 + 1,800 - 900 = 11,400\\) kg ✓\nThis cow has excellent genetics (\\(A = +1,800\\) kg), but experienced challenges (−900 kg)—perhaps mastitis, lameness, or feed delivery issues. Her phenotype underestimates her genetic merit.\nCow #3694 (Below-average producer) - Phenotype: \\(y = 9,300\\) kg - True breeding value: \\(A = -600\\) kg (genetically inferior) - Environmental deviation: \\(E = -600\\) kg - Check: \\(y = 10,500 - 600 - 600 = 9,300\\) kg ✓\nThis cow is both genetically below average and had poor environmental conditions.\nBreeding decisions:\nWith \\(h^2 = 0.30\\) (moderate heritability), phenotype is a moderate indicator of genetic merit. If we only had single lactation records:\n\nCow #4217 would be selected (highest phenotype)\nCow #5831 might be culled or given lower priority (moderate phenotype)\nCow #3694 would be culled (low phenotype)\n\nBut with BLUP breeding values (estimated using multiple lactation records, daughters’ production, and genomic information), we can more accurately rank their genetic merit:\n\n\nBest genetic merit: Cow #4217 (\\(A = +2,100\\) kg)\n\nSecond best: Cow #5831 (\\(A = +1,800\\) kg) ← Would be missed with phenotypic selection alone!\n\nPoor genetic merit: Cow #3694 (\\(A = -600\\) kg)\n\nImplications for daughter performance:\nIf we use these cows as dams (mated to a bull with breeding value \\(A_{sire} = +1,500\\) kg):\nDaughters from Cow #4217: Expected BV = \\((2,100 + 1,500) / 2 = +1,800\\) kg Daughters from Cow #5831: Expected BV = \\((1,800 + 1,500) / 2 = +1,650\\) kg Daughters from Cow #3694: Expected BV = \\((-600 + 1,500) / 2 = +450\\) kg\nCow #5831’s daughters will be excellent (+1,650 kg), despite her moderate phenotype in first lactation. This illustrates why accurate breeding value estimation is crucial—it helps us identify genetically superior animals even when their phenotypes are compromised by environment.\n\n3.6.2 Example 2: Weaning Weight in Angus Beef Cattle\nTrait: 205-day adjusted weaning weight (kg) Population: Commercial Angus herd\nPopulation parameters: - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)): 240 kg - Phenotypic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)): 625 kg² - Additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)): 281 kg² - Environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)): 344 kg² - Heritability (\\(h^2\\)): 0.45\nThree bull calves:\nCalf #127 (Heavy calf) - Phenotype: \\(y = 270\\) kg (+30 kg above mean) - Breeding value: \\(A = +18\\) kg - Environmental effect: \\(E = +12\\) kg - Check: \\(y = 240 + 18 + 12 = 270\\) kg ✓\nThis calf is both genetically superior and benefited from favorable conditions (good dam milk production, avoided illness, favorable birth date).\nCalf #243 (Average calf) - Phenotype: \\(y = 242\\) kg (+2 kg above mean) - Breeding value: \\(A = +12\\) kg (actually above average genetically!) - Environmental effect: \\(E = -10\\) kg - Check: \\(y = 240 + 12 - 10 = 242\\) kg ✓\nThis calf has decent genetics but experienced unfavorable conditions—perhaps born to a first-calf heifer with low milk production, or born late in the season.\nCalf #189 (Light calf) - Phenotype: \\(y = 220\\) kg (−20 kg below mean) - Breeding value: \\(A = -8\\) kg - Environmental effect: \\(E = -12\\) kg - Check: \\(y = 240 - 8 - 12 = 220\\) kg ✓\nThis calf is genetically below average and experienced poor conditions.\nBreeding decisions:\nWith \\(h^2 = 0.45\\) (moderate-to-high heritability), weaning weight is a fairly reliable indicator of genetic merit. However, environmental effects still matter:\nEstimated breeding values (EPDs, Estimated Progeny Differences in beef cattle terminology):\nUsing the formula \\(\\hat{A} \\approx h^2(y - \\mu)\\):\n\nCalf #127: \\(\\hat{A} \\approx 0.45 \\times 30 = +13.5\\) kg (true \\(A = +18\\) kg—underestimated slightly)\nCalf #243: \\(\\hat{A} \\approx 0.45 \\times 2 = +0.9\\) kg (true \\(A = +12\\) kg—severely underestimated due to poor environment!)\nCalf #189: \\(\\hat{A} \\approx 0.45 \\times (-20) = -9\\) kg (true \\(A = -8\\) kg—close)\n\nThe simple regression on phenotype misses Calf #243’s genetic merit because his phenotype was suppressed by poor environment. In practice, EPDs from breed associations use BLUP methods that account for: - Dam’s milk production (maternal effects) - Contemporary group (birth year, season, management) - Pedigree information (sire and dam EPDs)\nThis improves accuracy, especially for calves with environmental disadvantages.\nOffspring expectations:\nIf these bulls are used as sires (mated to average cows, \\(A = 0\\)):\n\nCalf #127’s offspring: Expected BV = \\(18 / 2 = +9\\) kg\nCalf #243’s offspring: Expected BV = \\(12 / 2 = +6\\) kg\nCalf #189’s offspring: Expected BV = \\(-8 / 2 = -4\\) kg\n\nCalf #243 will produce decent offspring (+6 kg) despite his modest phenotype.\n\n3.6.3 Example 3: Body Weight at 42 Days in Broiler Chickens\nTrait: Body weight at 42 days of age (market weight) Population: Commercial broiler line\nPopulation parameters: - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)): 2,800 g - Phenotypic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)): 10,000 g² - Additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)): 3,500 g² - Environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)): 6,500 g² - Heritability (\\(h^2\\)): 0.35\nThree male broilers from the same family:\nBird #4521 - Phenotype: \\(y = 3,050\\) g (+250 g) - Breeding value: \\(A = +140\\) g - Environmental effect: \\(E = +110\\) g - Check: \\(y = 2,800 + 140 + 110 = 3,050\\) g ✓\nGenetically superior and favorably positioned in the pen (good feeder access, avoided early disease).\nBird #4527 - Phenotype: \\(y = 2,920\\) g (+120 g) - Breeding value: \\(A = +160\\) g (best genetics of the three!) - Environmental effect: \\(E = -40\\) g - Check: \\(y = 2,800 + 160 - 40 = 2,920\\) g ✓\nBest genetic merit but slightly suppressed phenotype due to minor environmental challenges.\nBird #4539 - Phenotype: \\(y = 2,700\\) g (−100 g) - Breeding value: \\(A = -60\\) g - Environmental effect: \\(E = -40\\) g - Check: \\(y = 2,800 - 60 - 40 = 2,700\\) g ✓\nBelow-average genetics and environment.\nBreeding context:\nIn modern broiler breeding, family-based selection is used: siblings are evaluated together, and the average family performance helps estimate each bird’s breeding value more accurately than individual phenotype alone.\nIf these three birds are full siblings (same sire and dam), the family average phenotype is: \\[\\bar{y}_{family} = (3,050 + 2,920 + 2,700) / 3 = 2,890 \\text{ g}\\]\nThe family average is +90 g above population mean, suggesting the family has positive genetic merit. Even Bird #4539, with below-average individual phenotype, might have a positive estimated breeding value once family information is incorporated.\nSelection intensity and generation interval:\nBroilers have: - Short generation interval (9–12 months) - High selection intensity (thousands of birds evaluated, top 3–5% selected) - High reproductive rate (10–15 chicks per female per week in pedigree nucleus)\nCombined with moderate heritability (\\(h^2 = 0.35\\)), this allows rapid genetic progress—broiler growth rate has increased by about 30% per decade through selection.\nOffspring expectations:\nIf Bird #4527 is selected as a sire (best breeding value, \\(A = +160\\) g) and mated to an average dam (\\(A = 0\\)):\nExpected offspring BV = \\(160 / 2 = +80\\) g\nOver a 9-month generation interval, if breeders consistently select birds with \\(A \\approx +150\\) g, the population mean increases by roughly \\(+75\\) g per generation (accounting for selection intensity and accuracy). In 10 years (≈10 generations), this compounds to ≈750 g improvement—dramatic progress.\n\n3.6.4 Example 4: Racing Performance in Thoroughbred Horses\nTrait: Racing time index (lower = faster, expressed as deviations from par time) Population: North American Thoroughbreds\nPopulation parameters: - Mean (\\(\\mu\\)): 0 seconds (standardized) - Phenotypic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_P\\)): 4.0 sec² - Additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)): 0.6 sec² - Environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)): 3.4 sec² - Heritability (\\(h^2\\)): 0.15 (LOW—racing performance is highly environmental)\nThree horses:\nHorse A (Fast racer) - Phenotype: \\(y = -1.2\\) sec (1.2 seconds faster than par) - Breeding value: \\(A = -0.3\\) sec (modestly superior genetics) - Environmental effect: \\(E = -0.9\\) sec (excellent jockey, favorable track, peak fitness) - Check: \\(y = 0 - 0.3 - 0.9 = -1.2\\) sec ✓\nThis horse is a successful racer, but most of the fast times are due to environment (training, jockey skill, race strategy, track conditions), not genetics.\nHorse B (Moderate racer) - Phenotype: \\(y = -0.3\\) sec (slightly faster than par) - Breeding value: \\(A = -0.4\\) sec (better genetics than Horse A!) - Environmental effect: \\(E = +0.1\\) sec (slightly unfavorable conditions) - Check: \\(y = 0 - 0.4 + 0.1 = -0.3\\) sec ✓\nThis horse has better genetic merit than Horse A but worse race results due to less optimal management or luck.\nHorse C (Slow racer) - Phenotype: \\(y = +0.8\\) sec (slower than par) - Breeding value: \\(A = +0.2\\) sec (slightly inferior genetics) - Environmental effect: \\(E = +0.6\\) sec (poor training, injury, unfavorable conditions) - Check: \\(y = 0 + 0.2 + 0.6 = +0.8\\) sec ✓\nBelow-average genetics and poor environmental conditions.\nBreeding implications:\nWith very low heritability (\\(h^2 = 0.15\\)), racing performance is a poor predictor of genetic merit. This explains several puzzling observations in Thoroughbred breeding:\n\nMany successful racehorses fail as stallions: Their racing success was largely environmental, not genetic\nSome unsuccessful racehorses become excellent sires: They had genetic potential that wasn’t realized on the track due to injury, poor training, or bad luck\nProgeny testing is critical: The best way to evaluate a stallion is to observe his offspring’s performance (which reveals his true breeding value more accurately than his own race record)\n\nOffspring expectations:\nIf Horse A is used as a stallion (mated to an average mare, \\(A = 0\\)):\nExpected offspring BV = \\(-0.3 / 2 = -0.15\\) sec\nIf Horse B is used as a stallion:\nExpected offspring BV = \\(-0.4 / 2 = -0.20\\) sec (better!)\nHorse B will produce slightly faster offspring on average, despite his inferior race record. This is why Thoroughbred breeding is challenging—the animals with the best genetic merit aren’t always the ones with the flashiest racing careers.\nIn practice, Thoroughbred breeders rely heavily on: - Pedigree: Famous sires and dams command premium stud fees - Progeny testing: A stallion’s value increases if his offspring consistently run fast - Dosage and nicking theories: Attempting to identify favorable genetic combinations (though these have mixed scientific support)\n\n3.6.5 Summary Table: Comparing Examples Across Species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nTrait\n\\(h^2\\)\nInterpretation\nSelection Strategy\n\n\n\nDairy\nMilk yield\n0.30\nModerate\nMultiple lactations + genomic selection; accurate EBVs possible\n\n\nBeef\nWeaning weight\n0.45\nModerate-high\nSingle phenotype fairly reliable; EPDs from breed associations\n\n\nBroiler\nBody weight\n0.35\nModerate\nFamily-based selection; rapid progress due to short generation interval\n\n\nHorse\nRacing time\n0.15\nLOW\nPhenotype unreliable; rely heavily on pedigree and progeny testing\n\n\n\nKey takeaways from these examples:\n\nThe basic model \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\) applies universally across species and traits\nHeritability determines how well phenotype predicts genetic merit: High \\(h^2\\) → phenotype is reliable; low \\(h^2\\) → phenotype is misleading\nEnvironmental effects can be large, even for moderately heritable traits—this is why accurate breeding value estimation is crucial\nSelection strategies must adapt to the trait’s heritability and the species’ biology (generation interval, reproductive rate, cost of phenotyping)\nModern methods (BLUP, genomic selection) help us “see through” environmental noise to identify true genetic merit, especially for lowly heritable traits\n\nThese examples reinforce why animal breeding is both a science (quantitative genetics) and an art (interpreting data in context).

    "section": "\n3.7 Parent-Offspring Relationships",
    "text": "3.7 Parent-Offspring Relationships\nOne of the most beautiful and fundamental results in quantitative genetics is the linear relationship between parent and offspring breeding values. This relationship is the foundation for predicting response to selection, estimating heritability, and designing breeding programs.\n\n3.7.1 The Fundamental Relationship\nWhen two animals mate, their offspring inherits one allele at each locus from each parent. This leads to a simple but profound relationship:\n\\[\nA_{offspring} = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam} + MS\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(A_{offspring}\\) = Breeding value of the offspring - \\(A_{sire}\\) = Breeding value of the sire - \\(A_{dam}\\) = Breeding value of the dam - \\(MS\\) = Mendelian sampling deviation (random term)\nLet’s unpack each component:\nMidparent breeding value (\\(\\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam}\\)):\nThe offspring’s expected breeding value is the average of its parents’ breeding values. This makes intuitive sense: if you mate two animals with breeding values of +10 and +20, the offspring’s expected breeding value is (+10 + 20) / 2 = +15.\nThis is true on average across many offspring, but any individual offspring will deviate from this expectation due to Mendelian sampling.\nMendelian sampling (\\(MS\\)):\nAt each locus, the offspring randomly receives one of the sire’s two alleles and one of the dam’s two alleles. This random sampling creates variation among offspring from the same parents—full siblings have the same expected breeding value (midparent average) but different realized breeding values.\nProperties of Mendelian sampling: - Mean: \\(E(MS) = 0\\) (on average, no deviation from midparent) - Variance: \\(\\text{Var}(MS) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A\\) (in randomly mating populations) - Distribution: Approximately normal for polygenic traits\n\n3.7.2 Example: Swine Growth Rate\nConsider a mating between a boar and sow for growth rate (average daily gain):\nParents: - Boar: \\(A_{sire} = +80\\) g/day - Sow: \\(A_{dam} = +60\\) g/day\nExpected offspring breeding value: \\[\nE(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}(+80) + \\frac{1}{2}(+60) = +70 \\text{ g/day}\n\\]\nActual offspring (with Mendelian sampling):\n\n\nOffspring\n\\(A_{offspring}\\)\nMendelian Sampling\nInterpretation\n\n\n\nPig #1\n+85 g/day\n+15 g/day\nLucky—inherited better alleles\n\n\nPig #2\n+68 g/day\n−2 g/day\nClose to expected\n\n\nPig #3\n+55 g/day\n−15 g/day\nUnlucky—inherited worse alleles\n\n\nPig #4\n+73 g/day\n+3 g/day\nSlightly above expected\n\n\nMean\n\n+70.25 g/day\n+0.25\nVery close to expected\n\n\n\nAcross many offspring, the Mendelian sampling deviations average out to zero, and the mean offspring breeding value equals the midparent value (+70 g/day).\nWhy does Mendelian sampling occur?\nEven though both parents are genetically superior (both have positive breeding values), they’re not homozygous superior at every locus. For example:\n\nAt Locus 1: Boar might be \\(B_1B_1\\) (homozygous beneficial), Sow might be \\(B_1b_1\\) (heterozygous)\nAt Locus 2: Boar might be \\(B_2b_2\\) (heterozygous), Sow might be \\(b_2b_2\\) (homozygous inferior)\nAnd so on for thousands of loci…\n\nDepending on which alleles the offspring samples from each parent, it might get: - Lucky: More beneficial alleles than expected → positive MS - Average: About the expected mix → MS ≈ 0 - Unlucky: More inferior alleles than expected → negative MS\nThis is why full siblings can be quite different genetically—they have the same expected breeding value, but different Mendelian sampling realizations.\n\n3.7.3 Offspring Phenotype Expectations\nCombining the breeding value relationship with the phenotypic model (\\(y = \\mu + A + E\\)), we can predict offspring phenotypes:\n\\[\nE(y_{offspring}) = \\mu + E(A_{offspring}) + E(E_{offspring})\n\\]\nSince \\(E(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\\) and \\(E(E_{offspring}) = 0\\):\n\\[\nE(y_{offspring}) = \\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\n\\]\nThe expected phenotype of offspring equals the population mean plus half the sum of the parents’ breeding values.\nExample: If the population mean growth rate is 750 g/day, and we mate the boar (\\(A = +80\\)) and sow (\\(A = +60\\)) from above:\n\\[\nE(y_{offspring}) = 750 + \\frac{1}{2}(80 + 60) = 750 + 70 = 820 \\text{ g/day}\n\\]\nIndividual offspring will vary around this expectation due to Mendelian sampling and environmental effects:\n\\[\ny_{offspring} = 750 + 70 + MS + E\n\\]\nIf \\(\\sigma^2_A = 2,500\\) g²/day², then \\(\\text{Var}(MS) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A = 1,250\\) g²/day², so \\(\\sigma_{MS} = 35.4\\) g/day.\nIf \\(\\sigma^2_E = 1,500\\) g²/day², then \\(\\sigma_E = 38.7\\) g/day.\nThe phenotypic standard deviation for offspring from these parents is:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{y,offspring} = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(MS) + \\sigma^2_E} = \\sqrt{1,250 + 1,500} = 52.4 \\text{ g/day}\n\\]\nSo we’d expect offspring phenotypes to be roughly 820 ± 105 g/day (mean ± 2 SD), with most falling between 715 and 925 g/day.\n\n3.7.4 Parent-Offspring Regression and Heritability\nThe relationship between parent and offspring breeding values provides a way to estimate heritability from data. Consider the regression of offspring phenotype on midparent phenotype:\n\\[\ny_{offspring} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times y_{midparent} + residual\n\\]\nWhere \\(y_{midparent} = (y_{sire} + y_{dam}) / 2\\).\nThe slope of this regression (\\(\\beta\\)) is related to heritability:\n\\[\n\\beta = h^2\n\\]\nWhy? Because: 1. Offspring breeding value = \\(\\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\\) (expected, on average) 2. Midparent breeding value = \\(\\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\\) (exactly) 3. The covariance between offspring and midparent phenotypes depends on \\(\\sigma^2_A\\)\nThe regression slope turns out to equal the heritability. This provides a classical method for estimating \\(h^2\\) from family data.\nExample regression:\nSuppose we measure 100 sire-dam pairs and their 500 offspring (5 per pair on average) for weaning weight in swine. We plot offspring weaning weight (y-axis) vs. midparent weaning weight (x-axis) and fit a linear regression:\n\nIf the slope is \\(\\beta = 0.30\\), then \\(\\hat{h}^2 = 0.30\\) (30% of phenotypic variance is additive genetic)\nIf the slope is \\(\\beta = 0.60\\), then \\(\\hat{h}^2 = 0.60\\) (60% additive genetic)\n\nThe scatter around the regression line represents: - Mendelian sampling: Even with the same parents (same midparent value), offspring vary - Environmental effects: Offspring experience different environments\n\n3.7.5 Why Offspring Don’t Equal Their Parents\nStudents sometimes wonder: “If offspring inherit half their genes from each parent, why don’t offspring exactly equal the midparent average?”\nThree reasons:\n1. Mendelian sampling (genetic reason):\nEven though offspring inherit 50% of alleles from each parent, which alleles they inherit is random. Parents are heterozygous at many loci, so offspring can get better or worse combinations than expected.\n2. Environmental effects (non-genetic reason):\nOffspring phenotypes include environmental deviations (\\(E\\)). Even if an offspring’s breeding value exactly equals the midparent breeding value (no Mendelian sampling deviation), its phenotype will differ due to environment:\n\\[\ny_{offspring} = \\mu + \\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam}) + E_{offspring}\n\\]\nThe parents’ phenotypes included their environmental effects:\n\\[\ny_{sire} = \\mu + A_{sire} + E_{sire}\n\\] \\[\ny_{dam} = \\mu + A_{dam} + E_{dam}\n\\]\nThe offspring doesn’t inherit \\(E_{sire}\\) or \\(E_{dam}\\)—it gets its own independent \\(E_{offspring}\\).\n3. Dominance and epistasis (non-additive genetic reasons):\nIf parents had favorable dominance or epistatic deviations, those don’t transmit reliably. The offspring might have different dominance/epistatic values depending on which specific genotype combinations form.\n\n3.7.6 Regression Toward the Mean\nA consequence of the parent-offspring relationship is regression toward the mean: offspring of extreme parents tend to be less extreme than their parents (though still better/worse than average in the same direction).\nWhy? Because offspring breeding value = 1/2 (midparent breeding value), not the full parental deviation.\nExample:\n\nPopulation mean: 750 g/day\nElite boar with phenotype 900 g/day and breeding value \\(A = +100\\) g/day (the rest is environmental)\nElite sow with phenotype 880 g/day and breeding value \\(A = +80\\) g/day\n\nExpected offspring breeding value: \\[\nE(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}(100 + 80) = +90 \\text{ g/day}\n\\]\nExpected offspring phenotype (with average environment): \\[\nE(y_{offspring}) = 750 + 90 = 840 \\text{ g/day}\n\\]\nThe parents averaged (900 + 880) / 2 = 890 g/day phenotypically, but offspring are expected to average only 840 g/day. This is regression toward the mean—offspring are still well above average (+90 g/day), but not as extreme as their parents’ phenotypes suggested.\nThis is not a failure of selection—the offspring are genetically superior (+90 g/day breeding value). It’s simply that: 1. Offspring inherit half of each parent’s breeding value (dilution effect) 2. Offspring don’t inherit their parents’ lucky environments\n\n3.7.7 Full-Sib vs. Half-Sib Families\nThe parent-offspring relationship helps us understand why different types of relatives resemble each other:\nFull siblings (same sire and dam): - Expected breeding value: Same for all (midparent average) - Variation: Due to Mendelian sampling (Var = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A\\)) - Correlation: \\(r_{full-sib} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) (ignoring dominance)\nHalf siblings (same sire, different dams, or vice versa): - Share one parent, so they share 25% of alleles identical by descent - Correlation: \\(r_{half-sib} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\nThese correlations form the basis for estimating heritability from family data (paternal half-sib design is common in livestock).\n\n3.7.8 Summary of Parent-Offspring Relationships\nKey insights from this section:\n\nOffspring breeding value equals midparent breeding value, on average: \\(E(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\\)\nMendelian sampling creates variation among full siblings—they have the same expected BV but different realized BVs\nParent-offspring regression slope equals heritability (\\(\\beta = h^2\\)), providing a way to estimate \\(h^2\\)\nRegression toward the mean occurs because offspring inherit half of parental genetic merit and don’t inherit environmental effects\nResemblance between relatives (full sibs, half sibs, parent-offspring) depends on the proportion of alleles shared and provides information for estimating genetic parameters\n\nIn the next section, we’ll use R to simulate these concepts and visualize parent-offspring relationships under different heritability scenarios.",

    "text": "3.9 Summary\nThis chapter introduced the fundamental genetic model that underlies all of quantitative genetics and animal breeding. Understanding how phenotypes are determined by the combination of genetic and environmental effects is essential for estimating breeding values, predicting response to selection, and designing effective breeding programs.\n\n3.9.1 Key Points\nThe Basic Genetic Model\n\n\nPhenotype is the sum of genetic and environmental effects: \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\)\n\n\n\\(y\\) = observed phenotype (measurable)\n\n\\(\\mu\\) = population mean (estimable)\n\n\\(A\\) = additive genetic effect or breeding value (must be estimated)\n\n\\(E\\) = environmental deviation (unmeasurable for individuals)\n\n\n\nThe challenge of animal breeding is separating \\(A\\) from \\(E\\) so we can identify and select animals with superior genetic merit\n\nTypes of Genetic Effects\n\n\nGenetic effects partition into three types: \\(G = A + D + I\\)\n\n\nAdditive effects (\\(A\\)): Sum of average effects of alleles; breed true; determine breeding value\n\nDominance effects (\\(D\\)): Within-locus interactions; don’t breed true; contribute to heterosis in crossbreeding\n\nEpistatic effects (\\(I\\)): Between-locus interactions; don’t breed true; largely unpredictable\n\n\n\nOnly additive effects matter for long-term genetic improvement because:\n\nThey transmit predictably from parent to offspring: \\(E(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}(A_{sire} + A_{dam})\\)\n\nResponse to selection depends on additive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)), not total genetic variance\nDominance and epistasis “wash out” over generations—they don’t accumulate\n\n\n\nVariance Partitioning\n\nPhenotypic variance partitions into components: \\(\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_D + \\sigma^2_I + \\sigma^2_E\\)\nIn practice, we simplify to: \\(\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_E\\)\n\nHeritability (\\(h^2 = \\sigma^2_A / \\sigma^2_P\\)) quantifies the proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetics\n\nHigh \\(h^2\\) (0.40–0.70): Production and carcass traits → effective selection\nLow \\(h^2\\) (0.05–0.20): Reproductive and fitness traits → challenging selection\n\n\nVariance components are population-specific, not universal properties of traits\n\nParent-Offspring Relationships\n\nOffspring inherit half of each parent’s breeding value on average, plus Mendelian sampling variation\nParent-offspring regression slope equals heritability: \\(\\beta = h^2\\)\nRegression toward the mean occurs because offspring don’t inherit environmental effects and inherit only half of parental genetic deviations\n\nPractical Implications\n\nPhenotypic selection is effective for high-h² traits but misleading for low-h² traits\nModern breeding methods (BLUP, genomic selection) estimate breeding values more accurately than phenotypic selection alone, especially for lowly heritable traits\nDifferent species and traits require different breeding strategies based on heritability, generation interval, and reproductive rate\n\nThis chapter provides the theoretical foundation for the rest of the book. The concepts introduced here—breeding values, variance components, heritability—will be used throughout Chapters 5–13 as we develop more sophisticated selection and genomic methods.",

(Hint: Midparent phenotype deviation × \\(h^2\\))\nWhy do full siblings (same sire and dam) have different phenotypes and different breeding values, even though they have the same expected breeding value?\n\nA trait has phenotypic variance \\(\\sigma^2_P = 16\\) kg² and heritability \\(h^2 = 0.45\\). Calculate:\n\nAdditive genetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\))\nEnvironmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\))\nAdditive genetic standard deviation (\\(\\sigma_A\\))\n\n\nExplain why heritability is a population parameter, not a trait parameter. Give an example of how the same trait could have different heritabilities in two populations.\n\n3.10.2 Solutions\nProblem 1\nUsing \\(y = \\mu + A + E\\), we can solve for \\(E\\):\n\\[E = y - \\mu - A = 2,950 - 2,800 - 80 = +70 \\text{ g}\\]\nThe chicken experienced a favorable environmental effect of +70 g (perhaps better feeder access or avoided early disease).\n\nProblem 2\nDominance effects depend on specific genotype combinations at individual loci (having two different alleles creates the dominance effect). When parents reproduce, their alleles segregate and recombine with alleles from the other parent, creating new genotypes in offspring. The specific genotype combination that created the dominance effect in the parent is not preserved in the offspring—it’s “broken up” during meiosis and recombination.\nOver generations of selection, we can increase the frequency of beneficial alleles (which changes additive genetic effects), but we cannot reliably select for favorable dominance combinations because they don’t transmit as stable entities. Therefore, dominance creates short-term variation in individual phenotypes but doesn’t contribute to long-term, cumulative genetic improvement.\n\nProblem 3\n\nUsing the full model: \\(\\sigma^2_P = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_D + \\sigma^2_I + \\sigma^2_E\\)\n\n\n\\[\\sigma^2_D + \\sigma^2_I = \\sigma^2_P - \\sigma^2_A - \\sigma^2_E = 100 - 30 - 60 = 10 \\text{ units}^2\\]\n\nUsing the simplified model where we lump non-additive effects into environmental variance:\n\n\\[h^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_A}{\\sigma^2_P} = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.30\\]\nNote: The simplified model treats the 10 units² of dominance and epistatic variance as part of “environmental” (non-heritable) variation.\n\nProblem 4\nOffspring breeding value equals the midparent breeding value (on average):\n\\[E(A_{offspring}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{sire} + \\frac{1}{2}A_{dam} = \\frac{1}{2}(+120) + \\frac{1}{2}(+60) = +90 \\text{ g/day}\\]\nIndividual offspring will deviate from +90 g/day due to Mendelian sampling, but across many offspring, the average will be +90 g/day.\n\nProblem 5\nMidparent phenotype: \\[y_{midparent} = \\frac{12,000 + 11,400}{2} = 11,700 \\text{ kg}\\]\nMidparent deviation from population mean: \\[y_{midparent} - \\mu = 11,700 - 10,500 = +1,200 \\text{ kg}\\]\nEstimated offspring breeding value (using simple regression): \\[\\hat{A}_{offspring} = h^2 \\times (y_{midparent} - \\mu) = 0.35 \\times 1,200 = +420 \\text{ kg}\\]\nExpected offspring phenotype: \\[E(y_{offspring}) = \\mu + \\hat{A}_{offspring} = 10,500 + 420 = 10,920 \\text{ kg}\\]\n(This assumes average environment for offspring. Individual offspring will vary due to Mendelian sampling and environmental effects.)\n\nProblem 6\nFull siblings have different phenotypes and breeding values for two reasons:\n1. Mendelian sampling (different breeding values): Even though siblings have the same expected breeding value (midparent average), they sample different alleles from each parent during meiosis. At each locus, a sibling randomly receives one of the parent’s two alleles. With thousands of loci involved in quantitative traits, different siblings inherit different combinations, creating variation in breeding values. The variance among full-sib breeding values is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2_A\\).\n2. Environmental effects (different phenotypes): Each sibling experiences unique environmental effects (\\(E\\)) that affect its phenotype. Even siblings raised in the same pen don’t have identical environments—they compete for feed, experience different health challenges, and undergo random developmental variation. These environmental differences create phenotypic variation even if siblings had identical breeding values.\n\nProblem 7\n\n\\(\\sigma^2_A = h^2 \\times \\sigma^2_P = 0.45 \\times 16 = 7.2 \\text{ kg}^2\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2_E = \\sigma^2_P - \\sigma^2_A = 16 - 7.2 = 8.8 \\text{ kg}^2\\)\n\\(\\sigma_A = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_A} = \\sqrt{7.2} = 2.68 \\text{ kg}\\)\n\nThis means breeding values in the population have a standard deviation of 2.68 kg. About 68% of animals have breeding values within ±2.68 kg of the population mean.\n\nProblem 8\nHeritability is a population parameter because it depends on the amounts of genetic and environmental variation present in a specific population, not on the trait itself.\nThe same trait can have different heritabilities in different populations because:\nGenetic variance (\\(\\sigma^2_A\\)) can differ: - Populations with more genetic diversity (varied allele frequencies) have higher \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) - Populations under long-term selection may have reduced \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) as favorable alleles approach fixation - Small, inbred populations have lower \\(\\sigma^2_A\\) than large, diverse populations\nEnvironmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)) can differ: - Populations raised in uniform, controlled environments (e.g., commercial poultry) have low \\(\\sigma^2_E\\) - Populations in variable environments (e.g., range beef cattle) have high \\(\\sigma^2_E\\)\nExample:\nConsider weaning weight in swine:\nPopulation A (Commercial nucleus herd): - Uniform management, controlled feeding, excellent health care - \\(\\sigma^2_A = 4.0\\) kg² (maintained diversity) - \\(\\sigma^2_E = 3.0\\) kg² (low environmental variation) - \\(\\sigma^2_P = 7.0\\) kg² - \\(h^2 = 4.0 / 7.0 = 0.57\\)\nPopulation B (Small, backyard herd): - Variable management, mixed feeding, inconsistent health care - \\(\\sigma^2_A = 2.0\\) kg² (less genetic diversity due to small size) - \\(\\sigma^2_E = 8.0\\) kg² (high environmental variation) - \\(\\sigma^2_P = 10.0\\) kg² - \\(h^2 = 2.0 / 10.0 = 0.20\\)\nThe same trait (weaning weight) has dramatically different heritabilities (0.57 vs. 0.20) in the two populations due to differences in both genetic and environmental variance.",

    "text": "12.1 Introduction\nIn 2009, the dairy cattle breeding industry experienced a revolution. For decades, young bulls required expensive progeny testing—waiting 5-6 years to evaluate daughters’ milk production before widespread use. This changed dramatically when the USDA and dairy breed associations implemented genomic selection. Suddenly, a small tissue sample from a newborn calf could predict its genetic merit with remarkable accuracy, without waiting for daughters or even the bull’s own performance records.\nThis breakthrough stemmed from sequencing animal genomes and developing technologies to measure thousands of DNA variants across the genome simultaneously. The impact was immediate and profound: genetic progress in dairy cattle essentially doubled overnight. Generation intervals dropped from 6-7 years to 2-3 years. Young bulls no longer needed progeny testing. The cost per genetic improvement plummeted.\nWhat happened in dairy cattle has since spread across livestock breeding—swine, poultry, beef cattle, sheep, horses, and even companion animals now routinely use genomic technologies. Commercial breeding companies have restructured their entire operations around genomic selection. The transformation is so complete that today, genomics is simply how modern animal breeding is done.\nThis chapter introduces the genomic technologies that made this revolution possible. We’ll explore what DNA markers (SNPs) are, how we measure them, how we ensure data quality, and what applications they enable beyond genomic selection. By the end, you’ll understand the foundation on which modern breeding programs are built—and be prepared for Chapter 13, where we’ll dive into genomic selection methods themselves.",

    "section": "\n12.2 What is Genomics in Breeding?",
    "text": "12.2 What is Genomics in Breeding?\nGenomics in animal breeding refers to using genome-wide DNA information to improve genetic predictions and make better selection decisions. Instead of relying solely on pedigrees (who the parents are) and phenotypes (what the animal looks like or produces), we can now look directly at an animal’s DNA to predict its genetic merit.\n\n12.2.1 Three Key Advantages of Genomics\nGenomics provides three major improvements over traditional breeding methods:\n1. Direct measurement of genotype With traditional methods, we infer an animal’s genotype from its relatives’ and own performance. Genomics lets us measure the genotype directly by sequencing DNA. This captures Mendelian sampling—the random shuffling of chromosomes during gamete formation that makes full siblings genetically different.\n2. Early selection We can genotype animals at birth (or even as embryos), predict their breeding values immediately, and make selection decisions years before they would express the trait or produce offspring. This dramatically reduces generation intervals.\n3. Selection on expensive or sex-limited traits Some traits are difficult or expensive to measure (e.g., feed efficiency requiring individual intake measurement, or carcass quality requiring slaughter). Others can only be measured in one sex (e.g., milk production in females). Genomics enables accurate selection on these traits using DNA samples and data from relatives.\n\n12.2.2 Before and After Genomics\nLet’s contrast traditional breeding with genomic breeding using dairy cattle as an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nTraditional Breeding (Pre-2009)\nGenomic Breeding (Post-2009)\n\n\n\nInformation source\nPedigree + phenotypes from progeny\nPedigree + phenotypes + DNA markers\n\n\nYoung bull evaluation\nProgeny test: 5-6 years, 100+ daughters\nGenomic test: birth, no daughters needed\n\n\nGeneration interval\n6-7 years (waiting for progeny)\n2-3 years (select at birth)\n\n\nAccuracy for young bull\n~0.30 (parent average)\n~0.65 (genomic prediction)\n\n\nCost per evaluation\n$25,000-$50,000 (progeny testing)\n$50-150 (genomic testing)\n\n\nAnnual genetic gain\n~1% per year\n~2% per year (doubled)\n\n\n\nThe transformation has been similarly dramatic in other species, though the specifics vary. Swine breeding companies now genotype thousands of selection candidates annually. Broiler breeding programs use genomics to improve disease resistance and leg health. Even dog and cat breeders use genomic tools to screen for genetic diseases and verify parentage.\n\n12.2.3 Timeline of Genomics in Livestock\nThe genomic revolution in animal breeding unfolded rapidly:\n\n\n2001: Human genome sequenced (reference for all mammalian genomics)\n\n2004-2009: Livestock genome assemblies completed:\n\nChicken (2004)\nCattle (2009)\nPig (2009)\nSheep (2010)\nHorse (2009)\n\n\n\n2008-2010: First genomic selection implementations\n\nDairy cattle (2009, USA and Netherlands)\nBroiler chickens (~2010)\n\n\n\n2010s: Widespread adoption across species\n\nSwine breeding companies (2011-2014)\nBeef cattle breed associations (2012+)\nSalmon breeding (2012+)\n\n\n\n2015-2020: Single-step genomic BLUP becomes industry standard\n\n2020+: Whole genome sequencing reference panels, advanced methods\n\nEach species’ adoption timeline depended on industry structure, generation interval, and economic incentives. Dairy cattle adopted quickly due to long generation intervals and expensive progeny testing. Poultry breeding companies integrated genomics into existing family-based selection schemes. The common thread: once adopted, genomics transformed every breeding program.",

    "text": "12.3 DNA Markers: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)\nTo use genomics, we need genetic markers—specific locations in the genome where individuals differ. The most common and useful type of marker is the SNP (pronounced “snip”).\n\n12.3.1 What is a SNP?\nA Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a location in the DNA sequence where a single nucleotide (base pair) differs between individuals in a population.\nDNA consists of four nucleotide bases: A (adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine). At most locations in the genome, all individuals have the same base. But at some locations—roughly 1 in every 1,000 bases—variation exists.\nExample SNP:\nAnimal 1: …ATCGATTGCA… Animal 2: …ATCGGTTGCA…\nAt this SNP position, Animal 1 has an A allele and Animal 2 has a G allele. This single base difference is a SNP. Mammals have billions of base pairs, so millions of SNPs exist across the genome—far more than we need for breeding applications.\nWhere do SNPs come from? SNPs arise from random mutations that occurred in ancestral populations and were passed down through generations. Most SNPs are selectively neutral (don’t affect fitness), but some are located in or near genes and influence traits of interest. Even neutral SNPs are useful because they’re linked to causal mutations through linkage disequilibrium (more on this shortly).\n\n12.3.2 SNP Genotypes\nEach animal inherits one copy of each chromosome from its sire and one from its dam. Therefore, at each SNP location, an animal has two alleles—one from each parent.\nLet’s say a SNP has two possible alleles: A and G. An individual can have one of three genotypes:\n\n\nAA (homozygous for A)\n\nAG (heterozygous)\n\nGG (homozygous for G)\n\nIn genomic datasets, we typically code SNP genotypes numerically:\n\n\n0 = homozygous for the first allele (AA)\n\n1 = heterozygous (AG)\n\n2 = homozygous for the second allele (GG)\n\nImportant: The choice of which allele is “0” vs. “2” is arbitrary. We usually designate the allele that was more common when the SNP panel was designed as “0” (the reference allele) and the alternative allele as “2.”\nExample genotypes for 5 animals at 3 SNPs:\n\n\nAnimal\nSNP1\nSNP2\nSNP3\n\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n2\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n5\n1\n2\n0\n\n\n\nAnimal 1 is homozygous AA at SNP1 (genotype = 0), heterozygous at SNP2 (genotype = 1), and homozygous GG at SNP3 (genotype = 2).\n\n12.3.3 Allele Frequency\nAn important property of each SNP is its allele frequency—the proportion of chromosomes in the population carrying each allele.\nIf we have genotype data for many animals, we can calculate the frequency of allele A as:\n\\[\np = \\frac{2 \\times n_{AA} + n_{AG}}{2 \\times n_{\\text{total}}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\n\\(n_{AA}\\) = number of animals with genotype AA (coded as 0)\n\n\\(n_{AG}\\) = number of animals with genotype AG (coded as 1)\n\n\\(n_{\\text{total}}\\) = total number of animals\nWe multiply by 2 because each animal has 2 alleles\n\nThe frequency of allele G is simply \\(q = 1 - p\\).\nExample: Suppose we genotyped 100 cattle at a SNP and observed:\n\n25 animals with genotype 0 (AA)\n50 animals with genotype 1 (AG)\n25 animals with genotype 2 (GG)\n\nThe frequency of allele A is:\n\\[\np = \\frac{2(25) + 50}{2(100)} = \\frac{100}{200} = 0.50\n\\]\nSo allele A has frequency 50% in this population, and allele G also has frequency 50%.\nMinor Allele Frequency (MAF): The minor allele frequency is the frequency of the less common allele. If \\(p = 0.50\\), MAF = 0.50. If \\(p = 0.90\\), MAF = 0.10 (the G allele is minor). MAF is important for quality control (low-MAF SNPs provide less information and may be genotyping errors).\n\n12.3.4 Why SNPs are Useful for Breeding\nSNPs are the workhorses of genomic selection for several reasons:\n1. Abundant across the genome Millions of SNPs exist in livestock species. We can select thousands to hundreds of thousands that are evenly spaced across chromosomes, ensuring genome-wide coverage.\n2. Biallelic (simple) Most SNPs have only two alleles (A/G, C/T, etc.), making them easy to genotype and analyze. Contrast with older markers like microsatellites, which often had many alleles and were more complex.\n3. Stable within an individual Your genotype at a SNP doesn’t change throughout your life. We can genotype an animal once (at birth) and use that information forever.\n4. High-throughput genotyping Modern SNP chips can genotype 50,000 to 800,000 SNPs simultaneously from a single DNA sample, at low cost. This was impossible with older marker technologies.\n5. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causal mutations Most SNPs we genotype are not themselves causing variation in traits. Instead, they are linked (physically close on the chromosome) to causal mutations. When SNPs and causal mutations are inherited together (in LD), we can use SNP genotypes to predict breeding values even if we never identify the causal mutations themselves.\nLinkage disequilibrium is the key concept making genomic selection work. LD means certain alleles at different loci are inherited together more often than expected by chance (because they’re close together and recombination is rare between them). By genotyping SNPs across the genome, we effectively “tag” chromosomal segments and their associated genetic effects on traits.\nExample: Coat color in horses The “agouti” gene determines whether a horse is bay (black body with brown points) or black (entirely black). A SNP in the agouti gene is in perfect LD with the causal mutation. By genotyping this SNP, we can predict coat color without sequencing the entire gene. Similarly, thousands of SNPs across the genome tag segments affecting milk production, growth rate, disease resistance, etc.",

    "section": "\n12.4 SNP Chips (Arrays)",
    "text": "12.4 SNP Chips (Arrays)\nNow that we understand what SNPs are, how do we genotype thousands of them efficiently? The answer is SNP chips (also called SNP arrays or bead chips).\n\n12.4.1 What is a SNP Chip?\nA SNP chip is a piece of glass or silicon (about the size of a thumbnail) onto which hundreds of thousands of DNA probes have been attached. Each probe corresponds to a specific SNP location in the genome. When DNA from an animal is applied to the chip, it binds to the probes, and a scanner detects which alleles are present at each SNP.\nKey features:\n\n\nPre-designed panel: Each chip genotypes a fixed set of SNPs chosen during chip design\n\nHigh-throughput: One chip genotypes 50,000 to 800,000 SNPs from one DNA sample\n\nLow cost per SNP: Though the chip itself costs $30-$150, the cost per SNP is often &lt; $0.001\n\nSpecies-specific: Different chips exist for cattle, swine, poultry, horses, dogs, etc.\n\n12.4.2 How SNP Chips Work (Simplified)\nThe genotyping process involves several steps:\n1. DNA Extraction DNA is extracted from a tissue sample—typically blood, hair follicles, ear tissue, or nasal swabs. The sample is processed in a lab to isolate high-quality DNA.\n2. DNA Processing and Chip Hybridization The DNA is fragmented, amplified, and labeled with fluorescent markers. It’s then applied to the chip, where it binds (hybridizes) to probes corresponding to each SNP location.\n3. Scanning A laser scanner excites the fluorescent labels, and the emitted light indicates which alleles are present. Different alleles emit different fluorescence patterns (e.g., red for AA, yellow for AG, green for GG).\n4. Genotype Calling Software analyzes the fluorescence intensities and “calls” genotypes (0, 1, or 2) for each SNP in each animal. Quality scores indicate confidence in each call.\nYou don’t need to understand the detailed chemistry—the important point is that SNP chips enable cost-effective, accurate, high-throughput genotyping.\n\n12.4.3 Common SNP Chips by Species\nDifferent livestock and companion animal species have breed- and purpose-specific SNP chips.

Missing genotypes are imputed using the high-density reference panel. This maximizes information while minimizing cost.\nExample: Dairy cattle genomic strategy A typical dairy breeding program might:\n\nGenotype elite bulls with BovineHD (777K) or sequence them → reference panel\nGenotype bull calves (selection candidates) with GGP 50K → impute to HD\nGenotype females with GGP-LD (30K) → impute to 50K or HD\nTotal cost per bull calf: ~$35, vs. $25,000+ for progeny testing\n\n12.4.5 Cost Trends: The Genomic Revolution Became Affordable\nOne reason genomics spread so rapidly is that genotyping costs plummeted.\nSNP chip cost trends (per animal):\n\n\n2008: BovineHD chip = $250\n\n2010: Bovine50K chip = $150\n\n2015: GGP 50K = $40\n\n2020: GGP 50K = $30, GGP-LD = $15\n\n2025: GGP 50K = $30-35, GGP-LD = $15-20\n\nThis dramatic cost reduction—nearly 10-fold for routine genotyping—made genomics economically viable even for traits with modest economic value. Combined with imputation, programs can now genotype thousands of animals per year at costs far below traditional phenotyping and progeny testing.\nWhole genome sequencing (discussed next) is also declining in cost but remains more expensive (~$500-$2000/animal), so it’s reserved for key reference animals.",

    "text": "12.5 Bioinformatics Basics: Quality Control and Imputation\nOnce animals are genotyped, raw data must be processed and quality-controlled before use in genetic evaluations. Bioinformatics pipelines handle these steps.\n\n12.5.1 Genotype Quality Control (QC)\nNot all genotypes are called correctly. Poor-quality DNA, technical errors, or rare variants can lead to incorrect genotype calls. Quality control filters remove unreliable SNPs and samples before analysis.\nCall Rate\nCall rate measures the proportion of SNPs (or animals) successfully genotyped.\n\n\nAnimal call rate: Percentage of SNPs with successful genotype calls for a given animal\n\nSNP call rate: Percentage of animals with successful genotype calls for a given SNP\n\nThresholds (typical):\n\n\nAnimal call rate: ≥ 90% (remove animals below this)\n\nSNP call rate: ≥ 95-98% (remove SNPs below this)\n\nWhy filter by call rate? Low call rates indicate poor DNA quality (for animals) or problematic SNP assays (for SNPs). Including them adds noise and can bias estimates.\nExample: You genotype 1,000 pigs on a 60K SNP chip:\n\nOne pig has genotypes called for only 48,000 SNPs (call rate = 80%). → Remove this animal.\nOne SNP is successfully called in only 850 animals (call rate = 85%). → Remove this SNP.\n\nAfter filtering, you have ~995 pigs and ~58,000 SNPs remaining.\nMinor Allele Frequency (MAF)\nMinor allele frequency (MAF) is the frequency of the rarer allele at a SNP. Very low-MAF SNPs provide little information for genomic selection and are often genotyping errors or rare mutations.\nTypical MAF thresholds:\n\n\nMAF &lt; 0.01 or 0.05: Remove SNP\nRationale: Rare alleles contribute little to accuracy and increase computational burden\n\nWhy low-MAF SNPs are problematic:\n\nLow information content (most animals have the same genotype)\nPotentially genotyping errors (singletons or doubletons)\nPoor imputation accuracy (rare alleles hard to impute)\n\nExample: A SNP in Holstein cattle has the following genotypes in 1,000 animals:\n\nGenotype 0 (AA): 980 animals\nGenotype 1 (AG): 18 animals\nGenotype 2 (GG): 2 animals\n\nAllele frequency for G: \\(q = \\frac{2(2) + 18}{2(1000)} = \\frac{22}{2000} = 0.011\\)\nMAF = 0.011 (1.1%). This SNP would be removed if we use a MAF &gt; 0.05 threshold.\nHardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)\nHardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is a principle from population genetics stating that, under random mating and no selection or mutation, genotype frequencies should follow:\n\\[\nP(AA) = p^2, \\quad P(AG) = 2pq, \\quad P(GG) = q^2\n\\]\nWhere \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are allele frequencies.\nWhy test for HWE? Large deviations from HWE can indicate:\n\nGenotyping errors (e.g., heterozygotes miscalled as homozygotes)\nPopulation substructure (non-random mating)\nSelection at the locus\n\nHWE filtering: SNPs with extreme HWE p-values (e.g., \\(p &lt; 10^{-6}\\)) are often removed. However, some deviation is expected in selected populations, so thresholds must be chosen carefully.\nExample: Suppose we observe 100 animals with:\n\nGenotype 0: 50 animals\nGenotype 1: 20 animals\nGenotype 2: 30 animals\n\nExpected under HWE (if \\(p = 0.60\\)):\n\n\n\\(P(AA) = 0.36\\) → 36 animals\n\n\\(P(AG) = 0.48\\) → 48 animals\n\n\\(P(GG) = 0.16\\) → 16 animals\n\nObserved heterozygosity (20) is much lower than expected (48), suggesting possible genotyping errors. A chi-square test would flag this SNP for removal.\n\n12.5.2 Imputation\nImputation is the process of predicting missing genotypes or “filling in” low-density genotypes to higher density using a reference panel of animals genotyped at high density.\nWhy Imputation?\nImputation enables cost-effective genotyping strategies:\n\n\nCost savings: Genotype most animals with cheap low-density chips; impute to high-density\n\nCombining datasets: Merge animals genotyped on different chips\n\nWhole-genome sequence imputation: Impute chip genotypes to full sequence using sequenced reference animals\n\nExample: A swine breeding program genotypes 5,000 selection candidates per year:\n\n\nWithout imputation: Genotype all with 60K chip at $60/animal = $300,000/year\n\nWith imputation: Genotype with 20K chip at $25/animal = $125,000/year; impute to 60K using reference panel\n\nSavings: $175,000/year (58% reduction)\nHow Imputation Works (Conceptually)\nImputation exploits linkage disequilibrium and pedigree relationships.\n\n\nReference panel: Animals genotyped at high density (or sequenced)\n\nTarget animals: Animals genotyped at low density (subset of SNPs)\n\nShared haplotypes: Target animals share chromosome segments (haplotypes) with reference animals due to common ancestry\n\nPrediction: For each missing SNP in target animals, predict genotype based on reference haplotypes that match surrounding SNPs\n\nSoftware: Commonly used imputation programs include FImpute, Beagle, Minimac4, and Eagle.\nAccuracy of Imputation\nImputation accuracy depends on:\n\n\nReference panel size: Larger reference = better accuracy\n\nRelationship to reference: Close relatives impute more accurately\n\nLD in population: High LD (recent common ancestors) = better accuracy\n\nSNP density: Denser low-density chip = better imputation\n\nMAF of SNP: Common alleles impute better than rare alleles\n\nTypical accuracy (correlation between true and imputed genotypes):\n\nLow-density (10K) → medium-density (50K): 0.90-0.95\nMedium-density (50K) → high-density (770K): 0.95-0.98\nHigh-density → sequence: 0.85-0.95 (depends on MAF and reference panel)\n\nExample: Dairy cattle are imputed from GGP-LD (30K) to BovineHD (777K) using a reference panel of 5,000 sequenced bulls. Imputation accuracy for common SNPs (MAF &gt; 0.05) exceeds 0.98, meaning &lt;2% of imputed genotypes are incorrect. For rare variants (MAF &lt; 0.01), accuracy may drop to 0.70-0.80.\nEconomic Calculation: Imputation Cost-Benefit\nLet’s calculate the cost-effectiveness of imputation for a beef cattle seedstock operation:\nScenario: - Evaluate 500 bull calves per year for genomic EPDs - Option A: Genotype all with 50K chip ($40/animal) - Option B: Genotype all with LD chip ($18/animal), impute to 50K\nCosts:\n\n\nOption A: $40 × 500 = $20,000/year\n\nOption B: $18 × 500 + $2,000 (reference panel maintenance) = $11,000/year\n\nAccuracy loss: Imputed 50K genotypes have ~0.95 correlation with true genotypes. This causes a small reduction in genomic prediction accuracy (maybe 0.02-0.03 correlation units), but the cost savings far outweigh the minor accuracy loss.\nDecision: Most programs choose Option B (imputation).",

    "text": "12.6 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)\nWhile SNP chips genotype selected locations, whole genome sequencing determines the DNA sequence at every base pair.\n\n12.6.1 What is Whole Genome Sequencing?\nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome—roughly 3 billion base pairs in cattle, 2.8 billion in pigs, 1 billion in chickens.\nModern sequencing technologies (Illumina short-read sequencing, PacBio long-read sequencing) can sequence entire genomes in days at decreasing cost. The result is a file containing every nucleotide in the genome, including all SNPs, insertions, deletions, and structural variants.\n\n12.6.2 WGS vs. SNP Chips\nHow do SNP chips and WGS compare?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSNP Chip\nWhole Genome Sequencing\n\n\n\nVariants detected\n50,000-800,000 (fixed panel)\nMillions (all variants)\n\n\nCost per animal (2025)\n$15-150\n$300-2,000\n\n\nSequencing depth\nNot applicable\n10-30× (coverage per base)\n\n\nCausal mutations\nLikely in LD with causals\nCan identify directly\n\n\nStructural variants\nNot detected\nDetected (insertions, deletions, CNVs)\n\n\nData size\n~5-50 MB per animal\n30-100 GB per animal\n\n\nProcessing time\nHours\nDays to weeks\n\n\nPrimary use\nRoutine genomic selection\nResearch, reference panels, QTN discovery\n\n\n\nKey differences:\n\n\nCoverage: WGS captures all genetic variation; chips capture only pre-selected SNPs\n\nCost: WGS is 10-100× more expensive per animal\n\nCausal variants: WGS can find the actual mutations causing trait variation; chips rely on LD\n\nData management: WGS generates massive datasets requiring significant storage and computing\n\n12.6.3 Uses of Whole Genome Sequencing\nWGS is not yet routine for all animals but has several important applications:\n1. Identifying Causal Mutations (QTN)\nThe “holy grail” of genomics is finding Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTN)—the specific mutations causing variation in traits. WGS enables this through:\n\n\nFine-mapping: Narrow GWAS signals to single genes or variants\n\nCandidate gene sequencing: Sequence genes in QTL regions to find causal mutations\n\nFunctional validation: Test whether variants affect gene expression or protein function\n\nExample: POLLED mutation in cattle Horns vs. polled (naturally hornless) cattle is controlled by a variant in the POLLED gene on chromosome 1. WGS identified the causal variant—a duplication and complex rearrangement. Now breeders can genotype this variant directly (via SNP chip or targeted test) to select for polled cattle, eliminating the need for dehorning.\n2. Building Imputation Reference Panels\nMany breeding programs sequence key influential animals (elite sires, foundation dams) to create reference panels. Other animals are genotyped on chips and imputed to sequence level.\nBenefits:\n\nCapture rare variants that aren’t on chips\nIncrease genomic prediction accuracy (slightly)\nEnable QTN discovery in the population\n\nExample: 1000 Bull Genomes Project An international consortium sequenced &gt;10,000 cattle (bulls and cows) from many breeds. This reference panel is used worldwide to impute chip genotypes to sequence, enabling discovery of breed-specific and rare variants.\n3. Structural Variants (SVs)\nSNP chips detect single-base changes but miss larger variants:\n\n\nInsertions/deletions (indels): Small (1-1000 bp) or large (&gt;1 kb)\n\nCopy number variants (CNVs): Duplications or deletions of large segments\n\nInversions: Flipped chromosomal segments\n\nTranslocations: Movement of segments between chromosomes\n\nSome SVs have large effects on traits. WGS is required to detect them.\nExample: KIT duplication in pigs A duplication in the KIT gene causes the “dominant white” coat color in pigs (used in Large White and Landrace breeds). This variant is a CNV not easily detected by SNP chips.\n4. Research Applications\nWGS is essential for:\n\nGenome assembly and annotation (building reference genomes)\nEvolutionary studies (comparing species, breeds)\nFunctional genomics (gene expression, regulation)\nRare disease gene discovery\n\n12.6.4 WGS in Practice: Cost-Effective Strategies\nWhile WGS is expensive, strategic use makes it feasible:\nKey animal sequencing strategy:\n\nSequence top 1-5% of population (elite sires, influential dams)\nUse these as reference panel\nGenotype all selection candidates on chips ($30-50)\nImpute chip genotypes to sequence level\nUse imputed sequence for genomic prediction\n\nExample: Salmon breeding A salmon breeding company sequences 200 elite fish (cost: ~$200,000). They genotype 20,000 selection candidates on custom 200K SNP chips (cost: $500,000). Impute to sequence. Total cost: $700,000 for 20,000 animals sequenced-equivalent = $35/animal (much cheaper than sequencing all).",

    "text": "12.7 From Genotypes to Genomic Predictions\nWe’ve discussed what SNPs are, how we measure them, and how we process the data. Now: how do genotypes predict breeding values?\nThe short answer: genotypes across the genome capture variation in true breeding values because SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the actual causal mutations affecting traits. By estimating effects of many SNPs simultaneously (using phenotypic and genotypic data from a training population), we can predict the breeding value of any genotyped animal—even newborns with no phenotype or progeny.\n\n12.7.1 Genomic Relationship Matrix (Preview)\nOne key concept we’ll explore further in Chapter 13 is the genomic relationship matrix (G). This matrix quantifies the genetic similarity between all pairs of animals based on their SNP genotypes.\nUnlike pedigree-based relationships (which are expected values), genomic relationships are realized relationships—they capture the actual sharing of chromosome segments due to inheritance.\nKey idea: Two full siblings share 50% of their genes on average (pedigree relationship = 0.50), but the actual sharing varies due to Mendelian sampling (random segregation of chromosomes). One sibling might inherit more favorable alleles, the other fewer. Genomic relationships capture this realized variation.\nWe’ll calculate the G matrix and use it for genomic predictions in Chapter 13. For now, understand that genotypes provide far more information than pedigrees alone.",

    "section": "\n12.8 Applications of Genomics in Animal Breeding",
    "text": "12.8 Applications of Genomics in Animal Breeding\nGenomics has many applications beyond genomic selection (which we’ll cover in Chapter 13). Here are the most important uses in modern breeding programs:\n\n12.8.1 1. Genomic Selection\nGenomic selection is the primary application—using genome-wide SNP data to predict breeding values and make selection decisions. It has revolutionized animal breeding by increasing accuracy and reducing generation intervals.\nKey points:\n\nPredict breeding values (GEBVs) at birth\nAccuracy often 0.50-0.70 for young animals without own phenotypes\nMuch higher than parent average (~0.30-0.40)\nEnabled dairy cattle to double genetic gain per year\n\nWe’ll explore genomic selection methods in detail in Chapter 13.\n\n12.8.2 2. Parentage Verification and Pedigree Correction\nRecorded pedigrees often contain errors—misidentified sires or dams, incorrect birth records, etc. Errors are especially common in:\n\nMulti-sire breeding (multiple bulls with a group of cows)\nNatural mating (paternity uncertain)\nRecord-keeping errors\n\nSNP genotypes enable accurate parentage verification and correction.\nHow it works: Each offspring inherits exactly one allele at each SNP from each parent. By comparing offspring and candidate parents’ genotypes, we can identify true parents (many SNPs match Mendelian inheritance) and exclude false parents (many SNPs violate Mendelian rules).\nSoftware: Parentage programs (e.g., COLONY, AlphaAssign, BreedAssign) calculate likelihood ratios for each candidate parent pair.\nExample: Beef cattle A commercial cow-calf operation uses multi-sire breeding (4 bulls with 200 cows). After calving, all calves and bulls are genotyped. Parentage analysis assigns each calf to its true sire with &gt;99% confidence. This enables accurate pedigree-based or genomic evaluation, improving selection accuracy.\nImpact: Pedigree errors reduce genetic progress. Correcting pedigrees with genomics increases accuracy by 0.05-0.10 correlation units—a substantial gain.\n\n12.8.3 3. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) scan the genome to identify SNPs (or chromosomal regions) associated with traits of interest.\nProcedure:\n\nMeasure phenotypes for a trait (e.g., milk yield) in many animals\nGenotype all animals on SNP chip\nTest each SNP for association with the trait (regression or ANOVA)\nIdentify SNPs with significant associations (after correcting for multiple testing)\nInvestigate nearby genes as candidates for causal mutations\n\nGWAS can:\n\nDiscover QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) affecting traits\nIdentify candidate genes for further study\nPrioritize causal variants for functional testing\nImprove genomic predictions (if causal variants are included)\n\nExample: Milk fat percentage in dairy cattle GWAS identified a strong signal on chromosome 14 associated with milk fat percentage. The causal gene was later confirmed to be DGAT1 (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1), which encodes an enzyme in fat synthesis. A specific SNP in DGAT1 (K232A) explains ~50% of genetic variance in fat percentage.\nLimitations: GWAS requires large sample sizes (thousands of animals) and only detects common variants with moderate-to-large effects. Rare variants and small-effect loci are missed.\n\n12.8.4 4. Genomic Management of Inbreeding\nInbreeding reduces performance (inbreeding depression) and should be managed carefully. Traditional approaches use pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients, but these are expected values—they don’t capture actual inbreeding due to Mendelian sampling.\nGenomic inbreeding measures realized inbreeding directly from SNP genotypes. Several methods exist:\n\n\nRuns of homozygosity (ROH): Long stretches of homozygous SNPs indicate recent inbreeding\n\nGenomic inbreeding coefficient (F_G): Deviation of observed homozygosity from expected\n\nGenomic relationship to base population: Diagonal elements of G matrix\n\nWhy genomic inbreeding matters: Two animals with the same pedigree inbreeding (e.g., \\(F = 0.10\\)) can have different realized inbreeding. Genomic measures reveal which animals are truly inbred, enabling better mating decisions.\nApplication: Optimum contribution selection (OCS) Modern mating programs use genomic relationships to minimize inbreeding while maximizing genetic gain. This balances selection intensity with genetic diversity.\nExample: Dutch Holstein cattle Genomic selection increased selection intensity, accelerating inbreeding rate. To counteract this, breeding organizations implemented genomic OCS, constraining inbreeding by limiting mating of close genomic relatives. Genetic diversity was stabilized while maintaining rapid genetic gain.\n\n12.8.5 5. Identification of Genetic Defects and Disease Mutations\nSome inherited diseases are caused by single genes with large effects (recessive lethals, dominant disorders). Genomics enables discovery and management of these mutations.\nProcess:\n\nIdentify affected animals (e.g., calves with lethal defect)\nSequence affected and normal animals\nFind causal mutation (often recessive)\nDevelop diagnostic test (SNP chip or targeted assay)\nTest breeding animals; avoid matings producing affected offspring\n\nExamples in cattle:\n\n\nCVM (Complex Vertebral Malformation): Recessive lethal in Holsteins. Carriers identified via SNP test; matings between carriers avoided.\n\nCholesterol deficiency: Recessive lethal in Holsteins. Causative mutation in APOB gene identified via WGS.\n\nTibial hemimelia: Recessive lethal in Herefords. Mutation in ULBP23 gene identified.\n\nExamples in dogs:\n\n\nProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): Causes blindness in many breeds. Multiple gene mutations identified (e.g., PRCD-PRA); DNA tests available.\n\nDegenerative Myelopathy (DM): Neurological disease in German Shepherds and others. Mutation in SOD1 gene; testing prevents affected puppies.\n\nvon Willebrand Disease (vWD): Bleeding disorder in Dobermans and other breeds. Mutation in VWF gene; genotype before breeding.\n\nExample in cats:\n\n\nPolycystic Kidney Disease (PKD): Inherited kidney disease in Persians and related breeds. Mutation in PKD1 gene identified; testing eliminates disease from breeding populations.\n\nImpact: Genomic testing has virtually eliminated many lethal recessives from purebred livestock and companion animal populations. This improves animal welfare and reduces economic losses.\n\n12.8.6 6. Crossbred Performance and Breed Composition\nIn crossbreeding systems (common in swine, beef cattle, sheep), knowing an animal’s breed composition is valuable. Genomics can estimate breed proportions and predict crossbred performance.\nBreed composition from SNPs: Different breeds have distinct allele frequencies at many SNPs. By comparing an animal’s genotypes to reference populations (purebred animals from each breed), we can estimate the percentage of each breed in its ancestry.\nSoftware: ADMIXTURE, STRUCTURE\nExample: Beef cattle A commercial cow is genotyped. Analysis reveals she is 60% Angus, 30% Hereford, 10% Simmental. This information can guide mating decisions (e.g., use terminal sire to maximize heterosis) and explain performance (e.g., higher marbling from Angus ancestry).\nCrossbred genomic prediction: Recent methods extend genomic selection to crossbreds by modeling breed-specific SNP effects. This improves accuracy in commercial crossbred populations.",

    "text": "12.10 Summary\nThis chapter introduced genomics and its transformative role in animal breeding. Let’s recap the key points:\nDNA markers (SNPs):\n\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are single-base differences in DNA\nGenotypes coded as 0 (AA), 1 (AG), or 2 (GG)\nMillions of SNPs exist across genomes; we genotype thousands to hundreds of thousands\nSNPs are useful because they’re abundant, stable, and in linkage disequilibrium with causal mutations\n\nSNP chips:\n\nMicroarrays that genotype 10,000 to 800,000 SNPs simultaneously\nSpecies-specific chips for cattle, swine, poultry, horses, dogs, cats, sheep, aquaculture species\nCosts have dropped dramatically ($15-$150 per animal, depending on density)\nHigh-, medium-, and low-density options enable cost-effective imputation strategies\n\nQuality control and imputation:\n\nGenotype data must be quality-controlled (call rate, MAF, HWE)\nImputation predicts missing or low-density genotypes using high-density reference panels\nImputation enables cost savings (genotype most animals with cheap chips, impute to high density)\nAccuracy of imputation typically &gt;95% for common SNPs\n\nWhole genome sequencing:\n\nSequences every base pair (~3 billion in cattle)\nMore expensive than SNP chips ($500-2000 vs. $30-150)\nEnables identification of causal mutations (QTN), structural variants, and rare alleles\nUsed strategically: sequence elite animals, impute others to sequence\n\nApplications:\n\n\nGenomic selection (Chapter 13): Predict breeding values using genome-wide SNPs\n\nParentage verification: Correct pedigree errors using SNP-based parentage\n\nGWAS: Discover QTL and candidate genes for traits\n\nGenomic inbreeding management: Measure realized inbreeding, optimize matings\n\nGenetic defect identification: Find and manage lethal recessives and disease mutations\n\nCrossbred performance: Estimate breed composition, predict crossbred merit\n\nImpact:\nGenomics has revolutionized animal breeding. Genetic gain has doubled in dairy cattle, swine, and poultry breeding programs. Generation intervals have shortened.

    "section": "\n13.1 Introduction",
    "text": "13.1 Introduction\nIn 2001, Theo Meuwissen, Ben Hayes, and Mike Goddard published a paper that would fundamentally change animal breeding. Titled “Prediction of Total Genetic Value Using Genome-Wide Dense Marker Maps,” this landmark paper proposed something revolutionary: What if we could predict an animal’s breeding value directly from its DNA, without waiting for performance records or progeny data?\nAt the time, this seemed almost too good to be true. Traditional animal breeding relied heavily on performance testing and progeny trials, which took years to complete. A dairy bull, for example, needed 5-6 years of progeny testing before breeders could confidently estimate his genetic merit for milk production. By the time his breeding value was known, he might be past his prime reproductive years. The same challenges existed across all livestock species—genetic evaluation was accurate but slow.\nMeuwissen and colleagues proposed using thousands of DNA markers (SNPs) spread across the entire genome to capture the effects of all genes affecting a trait. Because these markers are in linkage disequilibrium with the actual causal mutations, they could “tag” the genetic variation responsible for differences in performance. With a large enough training population of animals with both genotypes and phenotypes, one could estimate the relationship between SNP patterns and breeding values. These estimated relationships could then be applied to young animals with only genotype data, providing accurate predictions at birth—or even as embryos.\nThe impact of this idea has been nothing short of transformative. Dairy cattle breeding adopted genomic selection in 2009, and the rate of genetic improvement immediately doubled. Similar revolutions followed in swine (2011-2014), poultry (2010-2015), and beef cattle (2012-2017). Today, genomic selection is the standard approach in nearly all major breeding programs worldwide.\nThis chapter explains how genomic selection works. In Chapter 12, we learned about SNPs, genotyping technologies, and data quality control—the raw materials of genomic selection. Now we’ll explore the statistical methods that turn genotype data into genomic predictions. We’ll cover three major approaches:\n\n\nGBLUP (Genomic BLUP): Uses a genomic relationship matrix to predict breeding values\n\nBayesian methods: Allows different SNPs to have different effect sizes\n\nSingle-step GBLUP: Combines pedigree and genomic information in one unified analysis\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you’ll understand why genomic selection has revolutionized animal breeding, and how breeding companies use these methods to accelerate genetic progress.",

    "section": "\n13.2 What is Genomic Selection?",
    "text": "13.2 What is Genomic Selection?\nGenomic selection is a method of predicting an animal’s breeding value using genome-wide SNP genotype data. The predicted value is called a GEBV (Genomic Estimated Breeding Value), which represents our best estimate of an animal’s true breeding value based on its DNA sequence.\nThe fundamental idea is elegantly simple:\n\n\nBuild a training population: Collect genotype and phenotype data (or conventional EBVs) on thousands of animals\n\nEstimate the relationship: Use statistical models to learn how SNP patterns relate to breeding values\n\nPredict for selection candidates: Apply the learned relationships to young, genotyped animals who don’t yet have their own performance records\n\nSelect the best: Choose parents based on GEBVs instead of waiting for performance or progeny data\n\nThis approach breaks the traditional trade-off between accuracy and generation interval that constrained animal breeding for decades.\n\n13.2.1 Traditional Selection (Pre-Genomics)\nBefore genomics, breeders faced a fundamental challenge: accurate genetic evaluation required time.\nFor a young dairy bull with no daughters yet, the only information available was his pedigree. His estimated breeding value was essentially the average of his parents’ EBVs—what we call the parent average or pedigree index. The accuracy of this prediction was modest at best:\n\n\nAccuracy for young animals: r ≈ 0.30-0.40 (based on parent average only)\n\nSelection intensity: Limited, because predictions were imprecise\n\nTo improve accuracy, breeders used progeny testing: mate the young bull to many cows, wait for daughters to lactate, measure their milk production, and calculate the bull’s EBV based on daughter performance. This worked well for accuracy:\n\n\nAccuracy with progeny data: r ≈ 0.85-0.90 (after 50-100 daughters with records)\n\nBut progeny testing came at a steep cost:\n\n\nGeneration interval: 5-7 years (birth → mating → daughters born → daughters mature → milk records collected → EBV computed)\n\nExpense: $25,000-$50,000 per bull (semen storage, matings, data collection)\n\nOpportunity cost: By the time a bull’s genetic merit was known, newer genetics might already be available\n\nThis same pattern held across species. In swine, boars needed progeny in multiple litters before feed efficiency could be accurately evaluated. In beef cattle, carcass merit could only be assessed after offspring were slaughtered. The fundamental constraint was always the same: accuracy required waiting for phenotypes, which meant long generation intervals and slow genetic progress.\n\n13.2.2 Genomic Selection\nGenomic selection changes everything by providing moderate to high accuracy at birth, without waiting for performance or progeny records.\nHere’s what genomic selection uses:\n\n\nTraining population: Animals with both genotypes and phenotypes (or traditional EBVs)\n\nDairy: Thousands of progeny-tested bulls with daughter records\nSwine: Thousands of pigs with growth, carcass, and reproduction records\nPoultry: Tens of thousands of birds with production records\n\n\n\nGenomic prediction model: Statistical method that learns how SNP patterns correlate with breeding values (more on this below)\n\nSelection candidates: Young animals with genotypes but no performance records\n\nThe result:\n\n\nAccuracy for young animals: r ≈ 0.50-0.70 (depending on training population size, heritability, and relationships)\n\nAt birth (or even as embryos): No need to wait for maturity or progeny\n\nGeneration interval: Cut in half or more\n\nDairy: From 6-7 years → 2.5-3 years\nSwine: From 1.8 years → 1.0-1.2 years\n\n\n\nThe key advantage is not just accuracy—it’s high accuracy with short generation interval. Recall the breeder’s equation from Chapter 6:\n\\[R = \\frac{i \\times r \\times \\sigma_A}{L}\\]\nGenomic selection improves both numerator (r increases for young animals) and denominator (L decreases because we don’t need to wait for progeny). The combined effect on genetic progress is dramatic: in U.S. dairy cattle, annual genetic gain for milk yield doubled from ~120 kg/year to ~250 kg/year after genomic selection was adopted in 2009.",

    "section": "\n13.3 Why Genomic Selection Works",
    "text": "13.3 Why Genomic Selection Works\nTo understand why genomic selection works, we need to recall a fundamental principle from Chapter 12: SNPs are not usually the causal mutations that directly affect traits. Instead, they serve as markers that are statistically associated with nearby causal mutations. This association, called linkage disequilibrium, is the genetic foundation of genomic prediction.\n\n13.3.1 Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association of alleles at different loci. When two loci are in LD, knowing the allele at one locus tells you something about the likely allele at the other locus.\nLD exists for several reasons:\n\n\nPhysical proximity: Loci close together on the same chromosome are less likely to be separated by recombination\n\nRecent mutation: Newly arisen mutations haven’t had time to recombine onto different genetic backgrounds\n\nPopulation history: Genetic drift, population bottlenecks, and selection create LD patterns\n\nLimited recombination: Even over many generations, recombination is a relatively slow process\n\nHere’s the key insight: If a SNP is in LD with a causal mutation (sometimes called a QTN—Quantitative Trait Nucleotide), then animals with a particular SNP allele will tend to have a particular QTN allele. The SNP “tags” the causal variant.\nFor example, imagine a causal mutation that increases milk production by 50 kg per lactation. A nearby SNP might be in strong LD with this mutation. Even though the SNP itself doesn’t affect milk yield, animals with the “A” allele at the SNP position will tend to carry the beneficial allele at the causal mutation. By tracking the SNP allele, we indirectly track the causal allele.\nThe strength of LD decays with physical distance. In cattle, SNPs separated by 50,000 base pairs (50 kb) might have moderate LD, while SNPs 1 million base pairs apart typically have little LD. This is why dense SNP panels (50K or 600K+ SNPs) are necessary—we need enough markers to ensure that most causal mutations are in LD with at least one SNP on the array.\n\n13.3.2 Capturing Additive Genetic Variance\nQuantitative traits like milk production, growth rate, and litter size are affected by hundreds to thousands of genes scattered across the genome. Each gene contributes a small amount to the total genetic variance. Genomic selection doesn’t require identifying every causal gene—it just needs enough SNPs in LD with enough causal loci to capture most of the additive genetic variance.\nWith a 50K SNP panel (one SNP every ~50,000 base pairs on average), we have excellent genome coverage in most livestock species. Even if we don’t know which SNPs are causal, the combination of all SNP effects will track the sum of nearby causal effects. This “polygenic” approach works remarkably well for complex traits.\nThe proportion of additive genetic variance captured depends on:\n\n\nSNP density: More SNPs = better LD coverage\n\nEffective population size (N_e): Smaller N_e = longer LD = fewer SNPs needed\n\nDairy cattle: N_e ≈ 100-150, medium LD\nSwine: N_e ≈ 100-300, medium LD\nPoultry: N_e ≈ 50-100, longer LD (easier to capture variance)\n\n\n\nRecombination rate: Varies across chromosomes and species\n\nIn practice, 50K SNP arrays capture 70-90% of additive genetic variance for most traits in dairy cattle. Higher-density arrays (600K+) capture slightly more, but the gain is modest. This is good news: we don’t need perfect genome coverage, just good coverage.\n\n13.3.3 Training Population\nThe training population (also called the reference population) is the cornerstone of genomic selection. These are animals with:\n\n\nGenotypes: SNP data from a chip or sequencing\n\nPhenotypes: Performance records, or conventional EBVs based on their own and relatives’ records\n\nThe training population is used to “train” the genomic prediction model—that is, to estimate how SNP patterns relate to breeding values. The larger and more representative the training population, the more accurate the genomic predictions will be.\nKey factors for an effective training population:\n\n\nSize: Larger is better. Thousands of animals are typically needed for moderate to high accuracy\n\nDairy: 10,000-50,000 bulls with progeny-tested EBVs\nSwine: 5,000-20,000 pigs with performance records\nPoultry: 20,000-100,000 birds (huge populations possible due to low genotyping costs)\n\n\n\nRelationship to selection candidates: Predictions are most accurate for animals closely related to the training population\n\nIdeally, training population includes sires, dams, and close relatives of candidates\nAccuracy declines if training and selection populations are distantly related (e.g., different breeds)\n\n\n\nPhenotype quality: Accurate, well-recorded phenotypes lead to better predictions\n\nTraining on progeny-tested EBVs (high accuracy) is better than training on single records\n\n\n\nUpdated regularly: As new data become available, re-train the model to maintain accuracy\n\nOnce the training population is established and the model is trained, we can predict GEBVs for any genotyped animal—even newborns with no performance records. This is the power of genomic selection: the training population does the “heavy lifting” of connecting genotypes to phenotypes, and selection candidates benefit from this accumulated knowledge.",

    "section": "\n13.4 Two Main Approaches to Genomic Prediction",
    "text": "13.4 Two Main Approaches to Genomic Prediction\nThere are two philosophical frameworks for genomic prediction, which differ in what they estimate:\n\n\nAnimal model approach (also called “breeding value model”): Estimate breeding values directly for each animal, using genomic relationships\n\nMarker effects model: Estimate the effect of each SNP, then sum SNP effects to calculate breeding values\n\nThese approaches sound fundamentally different, but mathematically they are often equivalent—they’re just different ways of parameterizing the same underlying model. However, they differ in computational approach, interpretation, and practical application.\n\n13.4.1 Animal Model Approach (GBLUP)\nIn the animal model approach, we estimate breeding values directly, just as in traditional BLUP (Chapter 7). The key difference is that we replace the pedigree relationship matrix (A) with the genomic relationship matrix (G).\nWhat we estimate: Breeding values (u) for each animal\nModel: \\[y = X\\beta + Zu + e\\]\nWhere:\n\n\ny = phenotypes (or EBVs from traditional evaluation)\n\nX = design matrix for fixed effects (contemporary groups, etc.)\n\nβ = vector of fixed effects\n\nZ = design matrix relating animals to records\n\nu = vector of breeding values (random effects)\n\ne = residual errors\n\nThe key difference from traditional BLUP: breeding values are assumed to follow:\n\\[u \\sim N(0, G\\sigma^2_u)\\]\nThat is, breeding values have a covariance structure defined by the genomic relationship matrix G (not the pedigree relationship matrix A).\nAdvantages:\n\nConceptually simple (same framework as traditional BLUP)\nG captures realized relationships (Mendelian sampling)\nEfficient computation for large datasets\nMost widely used in practice\n\nThis approach is called GBLUP (Genomic BLUP).\n\n13.4.2 Marker Effects Model Approach\nIn the marker effects model approach, we estimate the effect of each individual SNP, then sum those effects to calculate breeding values.\nWhat we estimate: SNP effects (β_j) for each of thousands of SNPs\nModel: \\[y = X\\alpha + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} x_j \\beta_j + e\\]\nOr in matrix notation: \\[y = X\\alpha + M\\beta + e\\]\nWhere:\n\n\ny = phenotypes\n\nX = design matrix for fixed effects\n\nα = vector of fixed effects\n\nM = matrix of SNP genotypes (rows = animals, columns = SNPs)\n\nβ = vector of SNP effects (one effect per SNP)\n\nm = number of SNPs (often 50,000+)\n\ne = residual errors\n\nOnce SNP effects (β) are estimated, we calculate the GEBV for animal i as:\n\\[GEBV_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_{ij} - 2p_j) \\hat{\\beta}_j\\]\nWhere:\n\n\nx_ij = genotype of animal i at SNP j (coded 0, 1, or 2)\n\np_j = allele frequency at SNP j in the base population\n\n\\((x_{ij} - 2p_j)\\) = centered genotype (centers at zero for the population mean)\n\nAdvantages:\n\nEstimates SNP effects directly (useful for identifying important genomic regions)\nCan apply different assumptions about SNP effect distributions (e.g., Bayesian methods)\nEasy to calculate GEBVs for new animals once β is estimated\n\nDisadvantage:\n\nComputationally challenging when m (number of SNPs) &gt;&gt; n (number of animals)\nRequires specialized algorithms (e.g., Bayesian MCMC)\n\nMethods in this category include SNP-BLUP (assumes all SNPs have equal variance) and Bayesian methods (allow SNPs to have different variances).\n\n13.4.3 Equivalence of GBLUP and SNP-BLUP\nUnder certain assumptions, GBLUP (animal model) and SNP-BLUP (marker effects model) are mathematically equivalent—they produce identical GEBVs.\nSpecifically, when:\n\nAll SNPs have equal variance (no large-effect QTL)\nThe genomic relationship matrix G is computed as: \\(G = \\frac{MM'}{2\\sum p_j(1-p_j)}\\) (VanRaden’s first method)\n\nThen the breeding values from GBLUP equal the sum of SNP effects from SNP-BLUP.\nThis equivalence is powerful: we can choose whichever approach is computationally convenient. For large datasets with many animals, GBLUP is often faster. For datasets with more SNPs than animals, SNP-BLUP may be more efficient.\n\n13.4.4 Practical Differences\nDespite mathematical equivalence, the two approaches differ in practice:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nAnimal Model (GBLUP)\nMarker Effects Model (SNP-BLUP, Bayesian)\n\n\n\nEstimates\nBreeding values (u)\nSNP effects (β)\n\n\nComputation\nFast for large n\nFaster for large m\n\n\nInterpretation\nDirectly provides GEBVs\nProvides SNP effects; sum to get GEBVs\n\n\nSNP information\nImplicit (via G matrix)\nExplicit (each SNP has estimated effect)\n\n\nFlexibility\nLess flexible (assumes equal variance)\nMore flexible (can vary SNP variances)\n\n\nSoftware\nASReml, BLUPF90\nBGLR, GenSel, brms\n\n\nUse case\nStandard industry practice\nResearch, QTL mapping, traits with major genes\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we’ll explore GBLUP, SNP-BLUP, and Bayesian methods in detail.",

    "text": "13.5 GBLUP (Genomic BLUP)\nGBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) is the animal model approach to genomic selection. It extends traditional BLUP (Chapter 7) by replacing the pedigree relationship matrix (A) with a genomic relationship matrix (G) that captures the actual realized relationships between animals based on their DNA.\nGBLUP was popularized by Paul VanRaden’s 2008 paper “Efficient Methods to Compute Genomic Predictions,” which provided computationally feasible methods for calculating G and solving genomic evaluations. Today, GBLUP is the foundation of genomic selection in dairy cattle, beef cattle, and many other species.\n\n13.5.1 Genomic Relationship Matrix (G)\nThe genomic relationship matrix (G) quantifies the genetic similarity between pairs of animals based on their SNP genotypes. It’s analogous to the pedigree relationship matrix (A), but instead of relying on expected relationships from the pedigree, G uses the realized (actual) sharing of genome segments.\nKey differences between A and G:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nA (Pedigree Matrix)\nG (Genomic Matrix)\n\n\n\nBased on\nPedigree records\nSNP genotypes\n\n\nRelationship\nExpected (average)\nRealized (actual)\n\n\nFull-sibs\nAlways 0.50\nVaries (e.g., 0.47-0.53)\n\n\nMendelian sampling\nNot captured\nCaptured\n\n\nUnknown pedigree\nCannot calculate\nCan still calculate\n\n\nSelf-relationship\n1.0 or 1 + F\nClose to 1.0 (with adjustments)\n\n\n\nThe beauty of G is that it captures Mendelian sampling—the random variation in which parental alleles are inherited by offspring. Even full-siblings don’t share exactly 50% of their genome; some pairs share 48%, others 52%, due to random segregation and recombination. G captures this variation, making predictions more accurate.\n\n13.5.2 Calculating G: VanRaden’s Method\nPaul VanRaden (2008) proposed an efficient method for computing G from SNP genotypes. The formula is:\n\\[G = \\frac{(M - P)(M - P)'}{2 \\sum_{j=1}^{m} p_j (1 - p_j)}\\]\nLet’s break down each component:\nM = Genotype matrix (n × m)\n\n\nn = number of animals\n\nm = number of SNPs\n\nM_ij = genotype of animal i at SNP j, coded as:\n\n0 = homozygous for allele 1 (e.g., AA)\n1 = heterozygous (e.g., Aa)\n2 = homozygous for allele 2 (e.g., aa)\n\n\n\nP = Matrix of expected genotypes under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)\n\n\nP_ij = \\(2p_j\\), where \\(p_j\\) is the frequency of allele 2 at SNP j\n\nAll animals in column j have the same value (the population mean genotype for that SNP)\nP represents the “baseline” genotype expected if SNPs were at population allele frequencies\n\n(M - P) = Centered genotype matrix\n\nSubtracts the population mean, so animals with more common alleles have values near zero\nThis centers the relationship matrix so the average relationship equals zero\n\n\\((M - P)(M - P)'\\) = Cross-product matrix (n × n)\n\nElement (i, i’) is the sum of products of centered genotypes across all SNPs for animals i and i’\n\nLarge values = animals share many alleles that deviate from the population mean (closely related)\nSmall or negative values = animals have different allele combinations (distantly related)\n\nDenominator: \\(2 \\sum_{j=1}^{m} p_j (1 - p_j)\\)\n\nSum of expected variance across all SNPs (under HWE)\nScales G so the diagonal elements (self-relationships) are close to 1.0\nThe factor of 2 accounts for diploid genomes\n\nInterpretation of G:\n\n\nDiagonal elements (G_ii): Self-relationship, typically near 1.0\n\nCan be &gt; 1 if the animal is more homozygous than expected (inbred)\nCan be &lt; 1 if more heterozygous than expected\n\n\n\nOff-diagonal elements (G_ij): Relationship between animals i and j\n\nG_ij = 0: Animals share genome at population average (unrelated)\nG_ij = 0.50: Animals share ~50% of genome (parent-offspring or full-sibs, on average)\nG_ij = 0.25: Animals share ~25% of genome (half-sibs or grandparent-grandchild, on average)\nG_ij &lt; 0: Animals are less related than population average (have opposite alleles)\n\n\n\n13.5.3 GBLUP Model\nThe GBLUP model is identical in structure to traditional BLUP, except we use G instead of A for the covariance structure of breeding values.\nMixed model:\n\\[y = X\\beta + Zu + e\\]\nWhere:\n\n\ny = vector of phenotypes (or de-regressed EBVs)\n\nX = design matrix for fixed effects (contemporary groups, sex, etc.)\n\nβ = vector of fixed effects\n\nZ = incidence matrix linking animals to records\n\nu = vector of breeding values (random effects)\n\ne = vector of residual errors\n\nVariance structure:\n\\[u \\sim N(0, G\\sigma^2_u)\\] \\[e \\sim N(0, I\\sigma^2_e)\\]\nWhere:\n\n\nG = genomic relationship matrix\n\n\\(\\sigma^2_u\\) = additive genetic variance\n\nI = identity matrix\n\n\\(\\sigma^2_e\\) = residual (error) variance\n\nThe mixed model equations (MME) are:\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} X'X & X'Z \\\\ Z'X & Z'Z + G^{-1}\\lambda \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{\\beta} \\\\ \\hat{u} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} X'y \\\\ Z'y \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nWhere \\(\\lambda = \\sigma^2_e / \\sigma^2_u\\) (the variance ratio).\nSolving these equations gives us:\n\n\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) = estimates of fixed effects\n\n\\(\\hat{u}\\) = GEBVs (genomic estimated breeding values)\n\nImportant note: You don’t need to solve MMEs by hand! Software packages (ASReml, BLUPF90, etc.) do this for you. The key concept is that GBLUP uses G instead of A, and this improves accuracy because G captures realized relationships.\n\n13.5.4 Advantages of GBLUP\n\n\nCaptures Mendelian sampling: G reflects actual genome sharing, not just expected relationships\n\nHigh accuracy for young animals: Animals with genotypes but no phenotypes can receive accurate GEBVs (r = 0.50-0.70) based on realized relationships with the training population\n\nWorks with incomplete pedigrees: G can be calculated even if pedigree is unknown (as long as genotypes are available)\n\nComputationally efficient: For large datasets (n &gt; 10,000), GBLUP is faster than marker effects models\n\nWidely implemented: Standard method in dairy, beef, swine, poultry\n\n13.5.5 Numerical Example: Calculating G\nLet’s calculate the genomic relationship matrix for 5 animals genotyped at 6 SNPs (in reality, we’d use 50,000+ SNPs, but the principle is the same).\nStep 1: Genotype data (M)\n\n\nAnimal\nSNP1\nSNP2\nSNP3\nSNP4\nSNP5\nSNP6\n\n\n\n1\n2\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n0\n2\n\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n\n\n4\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n5\n1\n1\n0\n1\n2\n2\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate allele frequencies (p_j)\nFor SNP1: p_1 = (2+1+0+2+1) / (2×5) = 6/10 = 0.60\nSimilarly:\n\np_2 = 0.50\np_3 = 0.40\np_4 = 0.60\np_5 = 0.60\np_6 = 0.60\n\nStep 3: Create P matrix (expected genotypes)\nP has the same dimensions as M, but every element in column j is \\(2p_j\\):\n\n\nAnimal\nSNP1\nSNP2\nSNP3\nSNP4\nSNP5\nSNP6\n\n\n\n1\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\n\n\n2\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\n\n\n3\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\n\n\n4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\n\n\n5\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\n\n\n\nStep 4: Compute (M - P) (centered genotypes)\n\n\nAnimal\nSNP1\nSNP2\nSNP3\nSNP4\nSNP5\nSNP6\n\n\n\n1\n0.8\n0.0\n-0.8\n0.8\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n\n2\n-0.2\n1.0\n0.2\n-0.2\n-1.2\n0.8\n\n\n3\n-1.2\n-1.0\n1.2\n-1.2\n0.8\n-1.2\n\n\n4\n0.8\n0.0\n0.2\n0.8\n-0.2\n-0.2\n\n\n5\n-0.2\n0.0\n-0.8\n-0.2\n0.8\n0.8\n\n\n\nStep 5: Compute \\((M-P)(M-P)'\\)\nThis is a 5×5 matrix. For example, element (1,1) is: \\[(0.8)^2 + (0.0)^2 + (-0.8)^2 + (0.8)^2 + (-0.2)^2 + (-0.2)^2 = 0.64 + 0 + 0.64 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 2.00\\]\nElement (1,2) is: \\[(0.8)(-0.2) + (0.0)(1.0) + (-0.8)(0.2) + (0.8)(-0.2) + (-0.2)(-1.2) + (-0.2)(0.8)\\] \\[= -0.16 + 0 - 0.16 - 0.16 + 0.24 - 0.16 = -0.40\\]\nCompleting all calculations (we’ll use R in the next section for this!):\n\\[\n(M-P)(M-P)' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2.00 & -0.40 & -1.60 & 1.60 & -0.40 \\\\\n-0.40 & 3.60 & -1.60 & -0.40 & 0.80 \\\\\n-1.60 & -1.60 & 6.00 & -1.20 & -1.20 \\\\\n1.60 & -0.40 & -1.20 & 2.00 & -0.40 \\\\\n-0.40 & 0.80 & -1.20 & -0.40 & 2.00 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nStep 6: Calculate denominator\n\\[2\\sum_{j=1}^{6} p_j(1-p_j) = 2[0.6(0.4) + 0.5(0.5) + 0.4(0.6) + 0.6(0.4) + 0.6(0.4) + 0.6(0.4)]\\] \\[= 2[0.24 + 0.25 + 0.24 + 0.24 + 0.24 + 0.24] = 2(1.45) = 2.90\\]\nStep 7: Compute G = \\((M-P)(M-P)' / 2.90\\)\n\\[\nG = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.69 & -0.14 & -0.55 & 0.55 & -0.14 \\\\\n-0.14 & 1.24 & -0.55 & -0.14 & 0.28 \\\\\n-0.55 & -0.55 & 2.07 & -0.41 & -0.41 \\\\\n0.55 & -0.14 & -0.41 & 0.69 & -0.14 \\\\\n-0.14 & 0.28 & -0.41 & -0.14 & 0.69 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nInterpretation:\n\n\nAnimal 1 and Animal 4: G_14 = 0.55 (closely related, share ~55% of genome above population average—possibly parent-offspring or full-sibs)\n\nAnimal 1 and Animal 3: G_13 = -0.55 (distantly related, share fewer alleles than population average)\n\nAnimal 3: G_33 = 2.07 (more homozygous than expected, or has unusual allele composition)\n\nIn practice, we’d use thousands of SNPs, which stabilizes these estimates. With only 6 SNPs, sampling variation is high.\nNext, we’ll implement this in R with a more realistic example.\n\n13.5.6 R Demonstration: Computing and Visualizing G\nLet’s calculate the genomic relationship matrix using real-scale data (10 animals, 1000 SNPs) and visualize the relationships.\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reshape2)  # For melting matrix for heatmap\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# Simulate genotype data\nn_animals &lt;- 10\nn_snps &lt;- 1000\n\n# Simulate genotypes (0, 1, or 2) with realistic allele frequencies\n# Most SNPs have intermediate allele frequencies (MAF &gt; 0.05)\nallele_freqs &lt;- runif(n_snps, min = 0.2, max = 0.8)\n\n# Generate genotype matrix M (n_animals × n_snps)\nM &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = n_animals, ncol = n_snps)\nfor (j in 1:n_snps) {\n  p &lt;- allele_freqs[j]\n  # Genotypes follow HWE: P(0) = (1-p)^2, P(1) = 2p(1-p), P(2) = p^2\n  M[, j] &lt;- sample(0:2, size = n_animals, replace = TRUE,\n                   prob = c((1-p)^2, 2*p*(1-p), p^2))\n}\n\n# Add animal names\nrownames(M) &lt;- paste0(\"Animal_\", 1:n_animals)\n\n# Display first 6 SNPs for first 5 animals\ncat(\"Genotype matrix M (first 5 animals, first 6 SNPs):\\n\")\n\nGenotype matrix M (first 5 animals, first 6 SNPs):\n\nprint(M[1:5, 1:6])\n\n         [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]\nAnimal_1    1    2    1    1    0    1\nAnimal_2    2    1    1    1    1    2\nAnimal_3    1    1    1    1    0    1\nAnimal_4    1    2    1    2    2    1\nAnimal_5    2    1    2    2    0    0\n\n# Step 1: Calculate allele frequencies from the data\n# (In practice, these might be from a larger reference population)\np_j &lt;- colMeans(M) / 2  # Allele frequency at each SNP\n\ncat(\"\\nFirst 10 allele frequencies:\\n\")\n\n\nFirst 10 allele frequencies:\n\nprint(round(p_j[1:10], 3))\n\n [1] 0.55 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.35 0.30 0.55 0.60 0.45 0.75\n\n# Step 2: Create P matrix (expected genotypes = 2 * p_j)\nP &lt;- matrix(rep(2 * p_j, each = n_animals), nrow = n_animals, ncol = n_snps,\n            byrow = FALSE)\n\n# Step 3: Center genotypes (M -

    "text": "13.6 SNP-BLUP and Marker Effects Models\nWhile GBLUP estimates breeding values directly using the genomic relationship matrix, marker effects models estimate the effect of each individual SNP. This approach provides explicit information about which genomic regions contribute to genetic variation—useful for understanding the genetic architecture of traits and for identifying candidate genes.\n\n13.6.1 SNP-BLUP\nSNP-BLUP is the marker effects equivalent of GBLUP. Instead of estimating n breeding values (one per animal), we estimate m SNP effects (one per SNP, where m might be 50,000 or more).\nModel:\n\\[y = X\\alpha + M\\beta + e\\]\nWhere:\n\n\ny = vector of phenotypes (n × 1)\n\nX = design matrix for fixed effects\n\nα = vector of fixed effects\n\nM = centered genotype matrix (n × m), where M_ij = x_ij - 2p_j\n\nβ = vector of SNP effects (m × 1)\n\ne = vector of residuals\n\nAssumptions:\n\nSNP effects are random: \\(\\beta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\beta)\\)\n\nAll SNPs have equal variance \\(\\sigma^2_\\beta\\)\n\n\nThis equal-variance assumption is key: SNP-BLUP treats all SNPs as contributing equally (on average) to genetic variation.\nEstimating SNP effects: We solve for \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) using ridge regression (penalized regression) or mixed model equations. The penalty shrinks small effects toward zero, preventing overfitting.\nComputing GEBVs from SNP effects:\nOnce we have estimated SNP effects \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), we calculate each animal’s GEBV by summing the contributions of all SNPs:\n\\[GEBV_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} (x_{ij} - 2p_j) \\hat{\\beta}_j\\]\nOr in matrix notation:\n\\[GEBV = M\\hat{\\beta}\\]\nWhere M is the centered genotype matrix.\nExample:\nSuppose we’ve estimated SNP effects for 3 SNPs:\n\n\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = +0.15\\) kg (increases milk yield)\n\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_2 = -0.08\\) kg (decreases milk yield)\n\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_3 = +0.22\\) kg (increases milk yield)\n\nAnd Animal A has centered genotypes:\n\nSNP 1: \\((x_{A1} - 2p_1) = 2 - 2(0.5) = 1.0\\)\n\nSNP 2: \\((x_{A2} - 2p_2) = 0 - 2(0.3) = -0.6\\)\n\nSNP 3: \\((x_{A3} - 2p_3) = 1 - 2(0.6) = -0.2\\)\n\n\nThen:\n\\[GEBV_A = (1.0)(0.15) + (-0.6)(-0.08) + (-0.2)(0.22) = 0.15 + 0.048 - 0.044 = 0.154 \\text{ kg}\\]\nAnimal A’s GEBV is +0.154 kg above the population mean for milk yield.\n\n13.6.2 Equivalence of GBLUP and SNP-BLUP\nHere’s a remarkable mathematical result: Under certain conditions, GBLUP and SNP-BLUP produce identical GEBVs. They are different parameterizations of the same underlying model.\nWhen they are equivalent:\n\nAll SNPs have equal variance (the SNP-BLUP assumption)\nThe genomic relationship matrix is computed as \\(G = \\frac{MM'}{2\\sum p_j(1-p_j)}\\) (VanRaden’s method)\n\nUnder these conditions:\n\\[GEBV_{GBLUP} = GEBV_{SNP-BLUP}\\]\nWhy this equivalence matters:\n\n\nComputational flexibility: Choose the approach that’s faster for your dataset\n\nGBLUP: Faster when n (animals) &lt; m (SNPs)—invert an n × n matrix (G) instead of solving m equations\nSNP-BLUP: Faster when m &lt; n (rare in livestock, but possible with low-density panels)\n\n\n\nInterpretability: SNP-BLUP provides explicit SNP effects (useful for genomic architecture studies), while GBLUP is a “black box”\n\nExtensions: SNP-BLUP framework allows relaxing the equal-variance assumption (Bayesian methods)\n\nMathematical connection:\nThe relationship between breeding values (u) and SNP effects (β) is:\n\\[u = M\\beta\\]\nAnd:\n\\[G = \\frac{MM'}{2\\sum p_j(1-p_j)} \\propto MM'\\]\nSo breeding values are linear combinations of SNP effects, and genomic relationships are determined by the similarity of SNP genotype patterns.\n\n13.6.3 When to Use SNP-BLUP vs. GBLUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation\nBest Approach\nReason\n\n\n\nStandard genomic evaluation (50K SNPs, 10,000+ animals)\nGBLUP\nFaster computation\n\n\nIdentifying important genomic regions\nSNP-BLUP\nProvides explicit SNP effects\n\n\nTraits with major QTL\nBayesian methods (next section)\nAllows unequal SNP variances\n\n\nIntegrating genotyped and non-genotyped animals\nSingle-step GBLUP (discussed later)\nHandles both efficiently\n\n\nResearch on genetic architecture\nSNP-BLUP or Bayesian\nInterpretable SNP effects\n\n\n\nIn practice, GBLUP dominates in industry because it’s computationally efficient and easy to implement in existing BLUP software.

    "section": "\n13.7 Bayesian Methods",
    "text": "13.7 Bayesian Methods\nBoth GBLUP and SNP-BLUP assume that all SNPs contribute equally (on average) to genetic variance. This is a reasonable first approximation for many traits, but it’s not realistic for all traits. Some traits are influenced by a few large-effect QTL, while most SNPs have little to no effect. Bayesian methods relax the equal-variance assumption and allow SNPs to have different effect sizes—or even zero effect.\n\n13.7.1 Motivation\nThe equal-variance assumption of SNP-BLUP implies that the genetic architecture is infinitesimal: thousands of genes each contributing tiny, equal effects. This assumption works well for traits like body weight or milk yield, which are truly polygenic.\nHowever, consider these examples where the infinitesimal assumption breaks down:\n\n\nMilk fat percentage in dairy cattle: The DGAT1 gene explains ~30% of genetic variance—one gene with a huge effect\n\nCoat color: A few major genes (MC1R, KIT, etc.) determine most variation\n\nPolled/horned in cattle: The POLLED gene has a near-Mendelian effect\n\nDisease resistance: Some pathogens have major resistance loci (e.g., MHC region)\n\nFor these traits, forcing all SNPs to have equal variance is inefficient. It would be better to estimate large effects for SNPs near major QTL and small (or zero) effects for SNPs in neutral regions.\nThis is exactly what Bayesian methods do: they use prior distributions that allow SNPs to have different variances, giving the model flexibility to identify major-effect loci while shrinking small effects toward zero.\n\n13.7.2 The Bayesian Framework\nIn Bayesian statistics, we combine:\n\n\nPrior distribution: Our beliefs about parameters before seeing data (e.g., “most SNPs have small effects”)\n\nLikelihood: The probability of the data given parameters\n\nPosterior distribution: Updated beliefs about parameters after seeing data\n\nFor genomic prediction, we specify a prior distribution for SNP effects (β) that reflects our belief about genetic architecture. The data then updates these priors, yielding a posterior distribution for SNP effects. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior.\n\n13.7.3 BayesA\nBayesA was proposed by Meuwissen, Hayes, and Goddard (2001) as one of the original genomic selection methods.\nKey idea: All SNPs have effects, but each SNP has its own variance.\nModel:\n\\[y = X\\alpha + \\sum_{j=1}^{m} M_j \\beta_j + e\\]\nPrior distributions:\n\\[\\beta_j | \\sigma^2_{\\beta_j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\beta_j})\\] \\[\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j} \\sim \\text{Scaled Inverse Chi-Square}(\\nu, S^2)\\]\nWhere:\n\n\n\\(\\nu\\) = degrees of freedom (typically 4-5)\n\n\\(S^2\\) = scale parameter (related to expected genetic variance)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nEach SNP has its own variance (\\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}\\))\nThe prior on \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}\\) has heavy tails, allowing some SNPs to have large variances (large effects)\nMost SNPs will have small variances, but the model is flexible enough to accommodate a few large-effect SNPs\n\nResult: SNPs near QTL get large effect estimates, while most SNPs get small (shrunken) estimates.\n\n13.7.4 BayesB\nBayesB extends BayesA by allowing some SNPs to have exactly zero effect.\nKey idea: Only a proportion (\\(\\pi\\)) of SNPs affect the trait; the rest have β_j = 0.\nModel:\n\\[\\beta_j = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{with probability } \\pi \\\\ N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}) & \\text{with probability } 1-\\pi \\end{cases}\\]\nWhere \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}\\) again follows a scaled inverse chi-square distribution (as in BayesA).\nInterpretation:\n\nThis is a mixture prior: SNPs are either “in the model” (with non-zero effect) or “out of the model” (zero effect)\n\n\\(\\pi\\) is pre-specified (e.g., \\(\\pi = 0.95\\) means 95% of SNPs have zero effect, 5% have non-zero effects)\nSNPs in the model can have large effects (heavy-tailed prior on variance)\n\nResult: The model performs variable selection—it identifies which SNPs are important and sets the rest to zero. This can improve accuracy for traits with few major QTL.\n\n13.7.5 BayesC and BayesCπ\nBayesC is similar to BayesB, but SNPs “in the model” all share the same variance (like SNP-BLUP), rather than having individual variances.\nBayesCπ (BayesC-pi) extends BayesC by estimating \\(\\pi\\) (the proportion of SNPs with zero effect) from the data, rather than pre-specifying it.\nKey idea: Let the data tell us how many SNPs affect the trait.\nModel:\n\\[\\beta_j = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{with probability } \\pi \\\\ N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\beta}) & \\text{with probability } 1-\\pi \\end{cases}\\]\nPrior on \\(\\pi\\):\n\\[\\pi \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)\\]\nOr a more informative prior, e.g., Beta(1, 10), which favors most SNPs having zero effect.\nInterpretation:\n\nThe model learns how “sparse” the genetic architecture is (i.e., what proportion of SNPs matter)\nIf the trait is highly polygenic, \\(\\pi\\) will be estimated near 0 (few SNPs excluded)\nIf the trait is oligogenic (few QTL), \\(\\pi\\) will be estimated near 1 (most SNPs excluded)\n\n13.7.6 Bayesian Lasso\nThe Bayesian Lasso uses a double exponential (Laplace) prior on SNP effects:\n\\[\\beta_j | \\lambda \\sim \\text{Double Exponential}(0, \\lambda)\\]\nInterpretation:\n\nThis prior strongly shrinks small effects toward zero (like ridge regression but stronger)\nAllows a few large effects to remain large\nDoes not perform explicit variable selection (all SNPs have non-zero effects, but many are tiny)\nComputationally faster than BayesA/B/C\n\n13.7.7 Comparing Bayesian Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nSNPs with β = 0?\nVariance per SNP\nEstimates \\(\\pi\\)?\nBest for…\n\n\n\nBayesA\nNo\nIndividual \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}\\)\n\nN/A\nModerate polygenicity, some large QTL\n\n\nBayesB\nYes (π pre-specified)\nIndividual \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta_j}\\)\n\nNo\nFew large QTL, sparse architecture\n\n\nBayesC\nYes (π pre-specified)\nShared \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta}\\)\n\nNo\nFew QTL, but equal-sized effects\n\n\nBayesCπ\nYes (π estimated)\nShared \\(\\sigma^2_{\\beta}\\)\n\nYes\nUnknown architecture, data decides\n\n\nBayesian Lasso\nNo\nRegularized via λ\nN/A\nFast computation, moderate sparsity\n\n\n\n13.7.8 When Bayesian Methods Help\nBayesian methods can improve genomic prediction accuracy over GBLUP/SNP-BLUP, but the gain depends on the trait’s genetic architecture:\nLarge gains (5-15% higher accuracy):\n\nTraits with a few major QTL (e.g., milk fat %, coat color, some disease resistance)\nOligogenic traits (controlled by 5-50 genes)\n\nModest gains (0-5% higher accuracy):\n\nModerately polygenic traits (e.g., milk yield, body weight)\nTraits where most QTL have small effects, but a few are larger\n\nLittle or no gain (&lt; 1% higher accuracy):\n\nHighly polygenic traits with purely infinitesimal architecture\nTraits with very low heritability (limited signal to detect QTL)\n\nTrade-off: Bayesian methods are computationally expensive. MCMC requires thousands of iterations, and each iteration updates thousands of SNP effects. For large datasets (50K SNPs, 10,000 animals), Bayesian methods may take hours to days, while GBLUP takes minutes.\n\n13.7.9 Software for Bayesian Genomic Prediction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\nMethods\nPlatform\nNotes\n\n\n\nBGLR\nBayesA, BayesB, BayesC, Bayesian Lasso, more\nR\nMost popular R package, well-documented\n\n\nGenSel\nBayesB, BayesCπ\nStandalone (Fortran)\nDeveloped by Rohan Fernando’s group (Iowa State)\n\n\nbayz\nFlexible Bayesian models\nR\nGeneral Bayesian modeling for genetics\n\n\nJWAS\nBayesian methods + single-step\nJulia\nFast, modern language\n\n\n\nExample using BGLR (conceptual):\nlibrary(BGLR)\n\n# y = phenotypes, M = genotype matrix\nfit_BayesB &lt;- BGLR(y = y, ETA = list(list(X = M, model = \"BayesB\")),\n                   nIter = 12000, burnIn = 2000)\n\n# Extract SNP effects\nbeta_hat &lt;- fit_BayesB$ETA[[1]]$b\n\n# Calculate GEBVs\nGEBV &lt;- M %*% beta_hat\nWe’ll demonstrate this in an R code example later in the chapter.\n\n13.7.10 Summary: Bayesian vs. GBLUP\n\n\nGBLUP: Fast, works well for most traits, industry standard\n\nBayesian methods: Slower, but can improve accuracy for traits with major QTL\n\nIn practice: Most breeding programs use GBLUP as the default, and apply Bayesian methods selectively for specific traits where QTL are known or suspected\n\nThe Bayesian alphabet represents an important methodological advance, but the computational cost means it’s not universally adopted.

    "text": "13.8 Single-Step Genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP)\nIn the early years of genomic selection (2009-2013), most breeding programs used a two-step (or multi-step) approach:\n\n\nStep 1: Estimate SNP effects (or build G matrix) using a training population of genotyped animals with phenotypes\n\nStep 2: Apply those SNP effects to predict GEBVs for selection candidates (young, genotyped animals without phenotypes)\n\nThis worked, but it had significant limitations. Enter single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP), which revolutionized genomic evaluation by elegantly combining pedigree and genomic information in one unified analysis.\n\n13.8.1 The Problem with Multi-Step Approaches\nMulti-step genomic selection had several drawbacks:\n\n\nGenotyped and non-genotyped animals analyzed separately:\n\nTraditional BLUP for non-genotyped animals (using pedigree A)\nGenomic BLUP for genotyped animals (using genomic G)\nNeed to merge results, which creates scaling issues\n\n\n\nSelection candidates not included in training:\n\nTraining population = animals with genotypes and phenotypes\nSelection candidates = animals with genotypes but no phenotypes\nSelection candidates don’t contribute to estimating SNP effects, even though they have relatives with data\n\n\n\nRe-estimation required:\n\nWhen new phenotypes arrive, must re-train the model from scratch\nComputationally inefficient\n\n\n\nEBVs and GEBVs on different scales:\n\nTraditional EBVs (pedigree-based) and GEBVs (genomic) can’t be directly compared\nRequires adjustments and approximations\n\n\n\n13.8.2 The Single-Step Solution\nSingle-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) solves all these problems by analyzing all animals—genotyped and non-genotyped—in one unified model. The key innovation is the H matrix, which combines pedigree (A) and genomic (G) relationships.\nKey insight: For genotyped animals, use their realized genomic relationships (G). For non-genotyped animals, use their expected pedigree relationships (A). Blend the two seamlessly in one relationship matrix.\nThe result:\n\nOne evaluation for all animals\n\nEBVs and GEBVs on the same scale (directly comparable)\n\nAutomatic updates when new data arrive (just re-run BLUP with updated H)\n\nOptimal use of all information (phenotypes, pedigrees, genotypes)\n\nssGBLUP was developed independently by two research groups in 2009-2010:\n\n\nAndres Legarra, Ignacio Aguilar, and Ignacy Misztal (2009): “A relationship matrix including full pedigree and genomic information”\n\nOle Christensen and Mogens Lund (2010): “Genomic prediction when some animals are not genotyped”\n\nToday, ssGBLUP is the industry standard for genomic evaluation in dairy cattle, beef cattle, and increasingly in swine and poultry.\n\n13.8.3 The H Matrix\nThe H matrix is a unified relationship matrix that combines pedigree and genomic information. For a population with both genotyped and non-genotyped animals, H is structured as:\n\\[\nH = \\begin{bmatrix}\nA_{11} + A_{12}A_{22}^{-1}(G - A_{22})A_{22}^{-1}A_{21} & A_{12}A_{22}^{-1}G \\\\\nGA_{22}^{-1}A_{21} & G\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis looks complex, so it’s more commonly expressed via the inverse:\n\\[\nH^{-1} = A^{-1} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & G^{-1} - A_{22}^{-1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\nA = pedigree relationship matrix for all animals (genotyped and non-genotyped)\n\nA_{22} = pedigree relationships among genotyped animals only (subset of A)\n\nG = genomic relationship matrix for genotyped animals only\n\n\n0 = blocks of zeros for non-genotyped animals (no genomic adjustment)\n\nInterpretation:\n\n\nNon-genotyped animals: Use \\(A^{-1}\\) (pedigree relationships), no adjustment\n\nGenotyped animals: Use \\(A^{-1}\\) + \\((G^{-1} - A_{22}^{-1})\\) — this replaces pedigree relationships with genomic relationships\n\nThe term \\((G^{-1} - A_{22}^{-1})\\) is the genomic correction: it adjusts pedigree relationships to genomic relationships for genotyped animals.\nPractical implementation: Most software (BLUPF90, ASReml) builds \\(H^{-1}\\) directly and solves mixed model equations. You don’t compute H explicitly—just provide the pedigree (A) and genotypes (to compute G).\n\n13.8.4 How ssGBLUP Works: A Conceptual Example\nImagine a dairy herd with:\n\n\n1000 cows with milk yield records\n\n400 cows are genotyped\n600 cows are not genotyped\n\n\n\n50 young bulls (selection candidates)\n\nAll 50 bulls are genotyped\nNone have daughters with records yet (no phenotypes)\n\n\n\nMulti-step approach (old way):\n\nTrain genomic model on 400 genotyped cows\nPredict GEBVs for 50 young bulls\nCompute traditional EBVs for 600 non-genotyped cows\nTry to merge GEBVs and EBVs (scaling issues!)\n\nSingle-step approach (ssGBLUP):\n\nBuild H matrix combining pedigree (all 1650 animals) and genotypes (450 animals)\nRun BLUP once using H\nObtain breeding values for all 1650 animals simultaneously\n\n400 genotyped cows: High accuracy (own data + genomic relationships)\n600 non-genotyped cows: Moderate accuracy (own data + pedigree relationships)\n50 young bulls: Moderate accuracy (no own data, but genomic relationships with genotyped cows)\n\n\n\nAll breeding values are on the same scale and directly comparable.\n\n13.8.5 Advantages of ssGBLUP\n\n\nUnified evaluation: All animals in one analysis, regardless of genotype status\n\nSame scale: EBVs and GEBVs directly comparable (no scaling adjustments needed)\n\nEfficient: Uses all available information optimally\n\nPhenotypes from genotyped and non-genotyped animals\nPedigree information for all animals\nGenomic information for genotyped animals\n\n\n\nEasy updates: When new animals are born or new phenotypes arrive, just re-run BLUP (no re-training of SNP effects)\n\nComputationally feasible: Despite large H matrices, sparse matrix algorithms make it fast enough for industry (evaluations of millions of animals)\n\nHandles complex pedigrees: Works even with incomplete or uncertain pedigrees (G provides information)\n\nNo need for separate training/validation: All animals with data contribute to the evaluation\n\n13.8.6 Adoption of ssGBLUP\nssGBLUP has been rapidly adopted across livestock species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAdoption Timeline\nImplementation\n\n\n\nDairy cattle (US)\n2017 (CDCB)\nHolsteins, Jerseys, all traits\n\n\nBeef cattle (US)\n2013-2018\nAmerican Angus (2017), multiple breeds\n\n\nSwine\n2015-present\nMajor breeding companies (PIC, Topigs, Genesus)\n\n\nPoultry\n2016-present\nCobb-Vantress, Aviagen, Hy-Line\n\n\nSheep\n2018-present\nLAMBPLAN (Australia), NSIP (US)\n\n\n\nToday, ssGBLUP is considered the gold standard for genomic evaluation.

    "section": "\n13.9 Accuracy of Genomic Predictions",
    "text": "13.9 Accuracy of Genomic Predictions\nOne of the most important questions in genomic selection is: How accurate will our predictions be? Accuracy determines the expected response to selection and whether genomic selection is worthwhile compared to traditional methods.\nThe accuracy of genomic prediction is the correlation between the estimated breeding value (GEBV) and the true breeding value (TBV):\n\\[r = \\text{Cor}(GEBV, TBV)\\]\nHigher accuracy means we’re ranking animals more correctly, leading to greater genetic progress.\n\n13.9.1 Factors Influencing Accuracy\nFive main factors determine the accuracy of genomic predictions:\n1. Size of Training Population (N)\nThis is the most important factor. Larger training populations provide more information for estimating SNP effects or building the G matrix.\n\n\nSmall N (&lt; 1,000): Accuracy is low (r ≈ 0.30-0.45), only slightly better than parent average\n\nModerate N (2,000-5,000): Accuracy is moderate (r ≈ 0.50-0.60)\n\nLarge N (10,000+): Accuracy is high (r ≈ 0.60-0.75), approaching progeny test levels\n\nDiminishing returns: Doubling the training population size does not double accuracy. To increase accuracy from 0.60 to 0.70 might require 4× more animals.\nSpecies differences:\n\nDairy cattle: N = 10,000-100,000 progeny-tested bulls (very large training populations)\nSwine: N = 5,000-20,000 pigs with performance records\nPoultry: N = 20,000-100,000 birds (can afford to phenotype many birds)\nBeef cattle: N = 5,000-30,000 (decentralized industry, smaller training populations)\n2. Heritability of the Trait (h²)\nHigher heritability means more genetic signal, making it easier to estimate breeding values accurately.\n\n\nLow h² (&lt; 0.15): Accuracy is limited (r ≈ 0.30-0.50), even with large N\n\nExamples: litter size, fertility, disease resistance\n\n\n\nModerate h² (0.20-0.40): Accuracy is moderate (r ≈ 0.50-0.65)\n\nExamples: milk production, growth rate, feed efficiency\n\n\n\nHigh h² (&gt; 0.40): Accuracy is high (r ≈ 0.65-0.80)\n\nExamples: body weight, carcass traits, egg weight\n\n\n\nKey insight: Genomic selection helps most for low-heritability traits, where traditional methods (progeny testing) were slow and inaccurate. For high-heritability traits, even simple selection (own performance) works well.\n3. Relationship Between Training and Selection Candidates\nGenomic predictions are most accurate when training and selection populations are closely related.\n\n\nClose relatives (e.g., parents, sibs, cousins in training population): High accuracy\n\nDistant relatives (e.g., different families or lines): Lower accuracy\n\nDifferent breeds: Very low accuracy (LD patterns differ between breeds)\n\nThis is why training populations must be continuously updated: as generations pass and selection proceeds, today’s selection candidates become less related to yesterday’s training population. Re-training with recent generations maintains accuracy.\n4. Effective Population Size (N_e)\nEffective population size determines the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population.\n\n\nSmaller N_e → Longer LD → Fewer SNPs needed to capture genetic variance → Higher accuracy with a given SNP density\n\nLarger N_e → Shorter LD → More SNPs needed → Lower accuracy with fixed SNP density\n\nLivestock populations typically have small N_e (50-300), which is favorable for genomic selection. This is one reason why genomic selection works so well in livestock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nEffective Population Size (N_e)\nImplication for Genomic Selection\n\n\n\nDairy cattle\n100-150\nGood LD, 50K SNPs sufficient\n\n\nBeef cattle\n150-500 (varies by breed)\nModerate LD, 50K SNPs good\n\n\nSwine\n100-300\nGood LD, 50K SNPs sufficient\n\n\nPoultry\n50-150\nExcellent LD, even 10K SNPs work well\n\n\n5. SNP Density\nMore SNPs mean better coverage of the genome and higher LD between markers and causal mutations.\n\n\nLow density (3K-10K SNPs): Lower accuracy, but cheap\n\nMedium density (50K SNPs): Good accuracy, standard in industry\n\nHigh density (600K-1M SNPs): Slightly higher accuracy, more expensive\n\nDiminishing returns: Going from 10K to 50K SNPs increases accuracy substantially (~10-15%), but going from 50K to 600K only increases accuracy by ~2-5%.\nImputation (Chapter 12) allows cost-effective use of high-density data: genotype animals with low-density chips, impute to high-density, and use imputed genotypes for prediction.\n\n13.9.2 Typical Accuracies\nHere are typical genomic prediction accuracies for different scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nAccuracy (r)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nParent average (no genomics)\n0.30-0.45\nTraditional pedigree index\n\n\n\nGenomic (young animal, h²=0.10, N=5,000)\n0.35-0.45\nLow h² trait, modest improvement\n\n\n\nGenomic (young animal, h²=0.30, N=5,000)\n0.50-0.60\nModerate h² trait, good accuracy\n\n\n\nGenomic (young animal, h²=0.30, N=20,000)\n0.65-0.75\nLarge training population\n\n\nGenomic + own phenotype\n0.60-0.80\nCombination of genomic and phenotypic info\n\n\n\nGenomic + progeny (n=20)\n0.80-0.90\nVery high accuracy, but slower\n\n\n\nProgeny testing (n=50-100 daughters)\n0.85-0.95\nGold standard, but slow and expensive\n\n\n\nKey comparison: Genomic selection gives young animals (at birth) the accuracy that used to require 10-20 progeny records, but in zero time.\n\n13.9.3 Deterministic Prediction of Accuracy\nDaetwyler et al. (2008) derived a simple formula for predicting the accuracy of genomic selection:\n\\[r = \\sqrt{\\frac{N h^2}{N h^2 + M_e}}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\nN = number of animals in the training population\n\nh² = heritability of the trait\n\nM_e = effective number of independent chromosome segments\n\nM_e depends on effective population size and genome size. For livestock:\n\nDairy cattle: M_e ≈ 1,000-2,000\nSwine: M_e ≈ 1,200-1,800\nPoultry: M_e ≈ 600-1,000 (smaller N_e, longer LD)\n\nInterpretation:\n\nAs N → ∞, accuracy approaches \\(\\sqrt{h^2} = h\\) (the theoretical maximum for predicting breeding values without progeny)\nAccuracy increases with N and h²\n\nAccuracy is limited by M_e: populations with smaller M_e (longer LD) reach high accuracy with fewer training animals\n\nExample calculation:\nFor dairy milk yield with h² = 0.30, N = 10,000, and M_e = 1,500:\n\\[r = \\sqrt{\\frac{10,000 \\times 0.30}{10,000 \\times 0.30 + 1,500}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3,000}{4,500}} = \\sqrt{0.667} = 0.82\\]\nThis is very close to empirical accuracies observed in U.S. dairy cattle genomic evaluations.\n\n13.9.4 Increasing Accuracy Over Time\nGenomic prediction accuracy increases as breeding programs mature:\n\n\nLarger training populations: As more animals are genotyped and phenotyped, N grows\n\nBetter phenotypes: Improved data collection (precision livestock farming) provides higher-quality phenotypes\n\nUpdated SNP panels: Higher-density chips and whole-genome sequencing capture more genetic variation\n\nImproved methods: Better statistical models (e.g., multi-trait, multi-breed, machine learning)\n\nThis creates a positive feedback loop: higher accuracy → faster genetic progress → better training population → even higher accuracy.\n\n13.9.5 R Demonstration: Simulating Genomic Prediction Accuracy\nLet’s use the Daetwyler formula to explore how training population size and heritability affect genomic prediction accuracy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Daetwyler et al.

    "text": "13.10 Comparing Pedigree (A) and Genomic (G) Relationship Matrices\nOne of the most profound insights from genomic selection is that realized relationships differ from expected relationships. The pedigree relationship matrix (A) tells us the expected proportion of genome shared between relatives, but the genomic relationship matrix (G) tells us the actual proportion shared.\nThis section demonstrates why G is more powerful than A, using both numerical examples and visualizations.\n\n13.10.1 Why A and G Differ\nPedigree relationships (A) are based on expected inheritance:\n\nParent-offspring: A_ij = 0.50 (always)\nFull-siblings: A_ij = 0.50 (always)\nHalf-siblings: A_ij = 0.25 (always)\nUnrelated: A_ij = 0 (if no common ancestors)\n\nGenomic relationships (G) are based on realized inheritance:\n\nParent-offspring: G_ij ≈ 0.50 (close to expected, little variation)\nFull-siblings: G_ij ~ Normal(0.50, SD ≈ 0.04) — varies from ~0.42 to 0.58\nHalf-siblings: G_ij ~ Normal(0.25, SD ≈ 0.03) — varies from ~0.19 to 0.31\nUnrelated: G_ij ≈ 0, but can be slightly negative (opposite alleles)\n\nSource of variation: Mendelian sampling — the random segregation of parental chromosomes and recombination during meiosis. Full-siblings receive different combinations of parental chromosomes, so they don’t share exactly 50% of their genome.\nThis variation is crucial for genetic progress: it’s why some offspring are genetically superior to their parents (they inherited favorable alleles), while others are inferior (they inherited unfavorable alleles). G captures this variation; A does not.\n\n13.10.2 Numerical Example: Full-Siblings\nConsider five pairs of full-siblings from the same parents. According to the pedigree (A matrix), all pairs should have relationship = 0.50. But with genomic data (G matrix), we might observe:\n\n\nPair\nA (expected)\nG (realized)\n\n\n\n1\n0.50\n0.48\n\n\n2\n0.50\n0.52\n\n\n3\n0.50\n0.47\n\n\n4\n0.50\n0.53\n\n\n5\n0.50\n0.49\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of G among full-siblings is typically ~0.03-0.04. This small variation is enough to improve genomic predictions significantly, because it captures which siblings inherited more favorable alleles.\n\n13.10.3 R Demonstration: Comparing A and G Matrices\nLet’s simulate a small pedigree, calculate both A and G matrices, and visualize the differences.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reshape2)  # For melting matrices\n\nset.seed(54321)\n\n# Simulate a pedigree: 2 parents, 8 full-sib offspring\nn_offspring &lt;- 8\nn_animals &lt;- 10  # 2 parents + 8 offspring\n\npedigree_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = 1:n_animals,\n  sire = c(0, 0, rep(1, n_offspring)),   # Parent 1 is sire\n  dam = c(0, 0, rep(2, n_offspring))     # Parent 2 is dam\n)\n\ncat(\"Pedigree structure:\\n\")\n\nPedigree structure:\n\nprint(pedigree_data)\n\n   id sire dam\n1   1    0   0\n2   2    0   0\n3   3    1   2\n4   4    1   2\n5   5    1   2\n6   6    1   2\n7   7    1   2\n8   8    1   2\n9   9    1   2\n10 10    1   2\n\n# Calculate pedigree relationship matrix (A) manually\n# For this simple pedigree (2 unrelated parents, 8 full-sib offspring)\nA &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n_animals, ncol = n_animals)\nrownames(A) &lt;- colnames(A) &lt;- paste0(\"Anim_\", 1:n_animals)\n\n# Diagonal elements (self-relationships) = 1\ndiag(A) &lt;- 1\n\n# Parents are unrelated to each other (A[1,2] = A[2,1] = 0)\n\n# Parent-offspring relationships = 0.5\nfor (i in 3:n_animals) {\n  A[1, i] &lt;- A[i, 1] &lt;- 0.5  # Sire to offspring\n  A[2, i] &lt;- A[i, 2] &lt;- 0.5  # Dam to offspring\n}\n\n# Full-sib relationships = 0.5\nfor (i in 3:n_animals) {\n  for (j in 3:n_animals) {\n    if (i != j) {\n      A[i, j] &lt;- 0.5\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ncat(\"\\nPedigree relationship matrix (A):\\n\")\n\n\nPedigree relationship matrix (A):\n\nprint(round(A, 3))\n\n        Anim_1 Anim_2 Anim_3 Anim_4 Anim_5 Anim_6 Anim_7 Anim_8 Anim_9 Anim_10\nAnim_1     1.0    0.0    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_2     0.0    1.0    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_3     0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_4     0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_5     0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_6     0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_7     0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5    0.5     0.5\nAnim_8     0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0    0.5     0.5\nAnim_9     0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    1.0     0.5\nAnim_10    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5    0.5     1.0\n\n# Simulate genotypes for all 10 animals (1000 SNPs)\nn_snps &lt;- 1000\nallele_freqs &lt;- runif(n_snps, 0.2, 0.8)\n\n# Parents: random genotypes\nparent1_geno &lt;- rbinom(n_snps, 2, allele_freqs)\nparent2_geno &lt;- rbinom(n_snps, 2, allele_freqs)\n\n# Offspring: inherit from parents (Mendelian segregation)\noffspring_geno &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = n_offspring, ncol = n_snps)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_offspring) {\n  for (j in 1:n_snps) {\n    # Each offspring gets one allele from each parent\n    allele_from_parent1 &lt;- sample(c(0, 1), 1, prob = c(2 -

The G matrix shows variation around those expected values—some pairs share more genome, others less.\nScatter plot: Points scatter around the y = x line. The scatter represents Mendelian sampling—the realized sharing of genome differs from the expected sharing. This scatter is genetic information that improves predictions.\nFull-sib variation: Even though all offspring pairs are full-siblings (same parents), their genomic relationships range from ~0.46 to 0.54. The animals with G &gt; 0.50 inherited more similar chromosome segments; those with G &lt; 0.50 inherited more different segments.\n\nWhy this matters for genomic selection:\n\nG differentiates among relatives who A treats identically\nThis extra information increases accuracy of genomic predictions\n\nExample: Two full-sib bulls might have A = 0.50 (identical), but G = 0.48 vs. 0.52. The bull with G = 0.52 is more similar to his high-producing sisters, so his GEBV for milk yield will be higher—even though they have the same pedigree!\n\nThis is the essence of why genomic selection works better than pedigree-based selection.",

    "text": "13.11 Impact of Genomic Selection on Livestock Breeding\nGenomic selection has transformed livestock breeding in ways that would have seemed impossible two decades ago. The speed and scale of genetic improvement have accelerated dramatically, creating economic value and addressing food security challenges. Let’s examine the impact in major livestock species.\n\n13.11.1 Dairy Cattle: The Genomic Revolution\nBefore genomics (pre-2009):\n\nYoung bulls underwent progeny testing: mated to hundreds of cows, wait for daughters to lactate, measure milk production\n\nGeneration interval: 6-7 years (birth → daughters born → daughters mature → daughters produce milk → bull evaluated)\n\nAccuracy: Very high (r ≈ 0.85-0.90) after 50-100 daughters, but slow\n\nCost: $25,000-$50,000 per bull for progeny testing\n\nGenetic gain: ~100-120 kg milk per year\n\nAfter genomics (2009-present):\n\nYoung bulls genotyped at birth, GEBVs calculated immediately\n\nGeneration interval: 2.5-3 years (bulls used at 1-2 years of age)\n\nAccuracy: Moderate to high (r ≈ 0.65-0.75) for genomic young bulls, without any daughters\n\nCost: $50-$100 for genotyping (1000× cheaper than progeny testing!)\n\nGenetic gain: ~230-250 kg milk per year (doubled compared to pre-genomics)\n\nKey statistics (U.S. Holsteins):\n\nAnnual genetic gain for milk yield increased from 120 kg/year (2000-2008) to 250 kg/year (2010-2020)\nGeneration interval decreased from 6.5 years to 2.8 years\nProportion of bulls progeny-tested dropped from 100% to &lt;10% (only elite sires are progeny-tested now)\nGenomic breeding values now standard for all traits (milk, fat, protein, fertility, health, longevity)\n\nEconomic impact:\n\nU.S. dairy industry saves &gt;$100 million/year in progeny testing costs\nFaster genetic gain adds ~$300 million/year in productivity improvements\nTotal economic benefit: ~$400 million/year\n\n13.11.2 Swine: Precision Breeding at Scale\nKey applications:\n\n\nFeed efficiency: Genomic selection enables accurate evaluation without expensive individual feed intake measurement\n\nBefore genomics: Feed efficiency required individual intake recording (expensive, labor-intensive)\nWith genomics: Select for feed efficiency using GEBVs (r ≈ 0.50-0.60), measure only a training population\nResult: Genetic gain for feed efficiency increased 2-3×\n\n\n\nLitter size: Low heritability (h² ≈ 0.10-0.15) trait benefits greatly from genomics\n\nGenomic selection improves accuracy by 30-50% compared to pedigree\nFaster improvement in number of pigs born alive and weaned\n\n\n\nCrossbred performance: Genomic evaluations now predict crossbred performance directly\n\nPurebred selection doesn’t always improve crossbred performance\nGenomic models trained on crossbred data improve crossbred outcomes\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\n2011-2014: Major breeding companies (PIC, Topigs Norsvin, Genesus) adopt genomic selection\n2015-present: Single-step genomic BLUP becomes standard\nTraining populations now exceed 20,000-50,000 animals in major companies\n\nImpact:\n\nGeneration interval reduced from 1.8 years to 1.2 years\nGenetic gain increased by 30-50% for most traits\nEnabled selection for novel traits (disease resistance, welfare indicators)\n\n13.11.3 Poultry: Extreme Selection Intensity\nUnique advantages for genomics in poultry:\n\n\nHuge training populations: 20,000-100,000 birds genotyped (low genotyping cost, high bird numbers)\n\nHigh selection intensity: Thousands of candidates evaluated, top 1-5% selected\n\nFamily-based structure: Pedigree hatching allows family evaluation with genomic data\n\nApplications:\n\n\nGrowth rate: Already high h², but genomics reduces generation interval\n\nFeed efficiency: Expensive to measure individually, genomics enables accurate selection\n\nLeg health: Low h², improved dramatically with genomics (welfare benefit)\n\nDisease resistance: Genomic selection for specific pathogen resistance (e.g., Marek’s disease, Salmonella)\n\nEgg production and quality: Maintained high production while improving shell strength, egg size uniformity\n\nImpact:\n\nGenetic gain increased 20-40% for most traits\nGeneration interval: already short (9-12 months), but genomics allows earlier selection (select at hatch based on parents’ GEBVs)\nAccuracy for young birds: r ≈ 0.60-0.75 (very high due to large training populations)\n\nExample: Broiler body weight at 6 weeks increased from ~2.5 kg (2000) to ~3.0 kg (2020), with much of the acceleration post-2010 due to genomics.\n\n13.11.4 Beef Cattle: Decentralized Adoption\nChallenges unique to beef:\n\nDecentralized industry (many independent breeders)\nSmaller training populations than dairy\nPhenotypes harder to collect (carcass traits measured post-slaughter)\n\nProgress:\n\n\nGenomic EPDs available since 2012-2015 for major breeds\n\nAmerican Angus Association implemented single-step GBLUP in 2017\nNow standard for young bull selection in seedstock herds\nParticularly valuable for:\n\n\nCarcass traits (marbling, ribeye area): Can’t measure on live animals, genomics enables selection without progeny slaughter\n\nFeed efficiency: Expensive to measure, genomics reduces cost\n\nDocility and calving ease: Low h², genomics improves accuracy\n\n\n\nAdoption:\n\n~40-60% of young bulls in major breeds are now genomically evaluated\nSmaller uptake than dairy (less integration, lower ROI for small breeders)\nRapidly growing as genotyping costs decrease\n\nImpact:\n\nYoung bull accuracy increased from r ≈ 0.30 (parent average) to r ≈ 0.45-0.55 (genomic)\nGenetic gain increased 15-30% (less dramatic than dairy, but significant)\n\n13.11.5 Sheep: Emerging Adoption\n\nLAMBPLAN (Australia) and NSIP (US) offer genomic evaluations\nSmaller training populations (5,000-15,000 animals)\nAccuracy improvements modest but valuable\nCost-benefit still being established for commercial producers\n\n13.11.6 Summary of Industry Impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAdoption Year\nGenetic Gain Increase\nGeneration Interval Change\nKey Benefit\n\n\n\nDairy\n2009\n2× (doubled)\n6.5 yr → 2.8 yr\nEliminated progeny testing\n\n\nSwine\n2011-2014\n1.3-1.5×\n1.8 yr → 1.2 yr\nFeed efficiency, crossbred performance\n\n\nPoultry\n2010-2015\n1.2-1.4×\nMinimal change (already short)\nLeg health, disease resistance\n\n\nBeef\n2012-2017\n1.15-1.30×\nModerate decrease\nCarcass traits, young bull accuracy\n\n\n\nGenomic selection is now the industry standard in all major livestock species. The technology has matured from experimental (2008-2010) to routine (2015+), delivering sustained economic value and accelerating genetic progress worldwide.",

    "text": "13.12 Summary\nGenomic selection has revolutionized animal breeding by enabling accurate prediction of breeding values using genome-wide SNP data. This chapter covered the foundational concepts, methods, and industry impact of genomic selection.\n\n13.12.1 Key Concepts\n\nGenomic selection predicts breeding values (GEBVs) from SNP genotypes, providing moderate to high accuracy for young animals without phenotypes or progeny data\n\nTwo approaches to genomic prediction:\n\n\nAnimal model (GBLUP): Estimates breeding values using genomic relationship matrix (G)\n\nMarker effects model (SNP-BLUP, Bayesian): Estimates effects of individual SNPs, then sums to get GEBVs\nThese approaches are mathematically equivalent under certain assumptions\n\n\nGBLUP uses the genomic relationship matrix (G) to capture realized relationships between animals, accounting for Mendelian sampling that pedigree (A) cannot\nBayesian methods (BayesA, B, C, Cπ, Lasso) allow SNPs to have different effect sizes and can improve accuracy for traits with major QTL\nSingle-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) combines pedigree and genomic information in one unified analysis, making it the industry standard for routine evaluations\nAccuracy of genomic predictions depends on training population size (N), heritability (h²), effective population size (N_e), SNP density, and relationships between training and selection candidates\nPedigree (A) vs. genomic (G) relationships: G captures Mendelian sampling variation that A treats as constant, providing extra genetic information that improves predictions\nIndustry impact: Genomic selection has doubled genetic gain in dairy cattle, increased gain by 30-50% in swine and poultry, and transformed breeding programs across all major livestock species\n\n13.12.2 The Big Picture\nGenomic selection broke the trade-off between accuracy and generation interval that constrained animal breeding for a century. By providing accurate breeding values at birth, genomic selection:\n\n\nReduces generation interval (L) by eliminating progeny testing\n\nIncreases accuracy (r) for young animals without phenotypes\n\nEnables selection for expensive-to-measure traits (feed efficiency, disease resistance, carcass quality)\n\nAccelerates genetic progress: \\(R = i \\times r \\times \\sigma_A / L\\) increases due to higher r and lower L\n\nThe result is faster, cheaper, and more effective genetic improvement—benefiting producers, consumers, and animal welfare.",

    "text": "13.13 Practice Problems\n\nConceptual understanding: Explain why genomic selection is particularly beneficial for traits with low heritability (e.g., fertility, disease resistance). Why does genomic selection help more for these traits than for high-heritability traits?\nAccuracy calculation: A dairy breeding program has a training population of 5,000 bulls with phenotypes and genotypes. For a trait with h² = 0.25 and M_e = 1,200, estimate the accuracy of genomic predictions using the Daetwyler formula: \\[r = \\sqrt{\\frac{N h^2}{N h^2 + M_e}}\\] How does this compare to the parent average accuracy (r ≈ 0.35)?\nMethods comparison: Compare GBLUP, SNP-BLUP, and Bayesian methods (BayesB). When would you choose each approach? Give specific examples of traits where each method would be most appropriate.\nSingle-step GBLUP: Explain how single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) combines pedigree and genomic information. What are the advantages of ssGBLUP over multi-step approaches? Why has ssGBLUP become the industry standard?\nG matrix interpretation: In a genomic relationship matrix (G), you observe that two full-sibling bulls have G_12 = 0.47 while two other full-sibling bulls have G_34 = 0.53. Their pedigree relationships are both A_12 = A_34 = 0.50. Explain why G values differ, and what this means for genomic selection.\n\nTraining population size: A swine breeding company is deciding whether to genotype 2,000 or 10,000 animals for their training population. For a trait with h² = 0.30 and M_e = 1,400:\n\nCalculate the expected accuracy for each training population size\nHow much does accuracy improve by increasing from 2,000 to 10,000?\nDiscuss the cost-benefit trade-off of the larger training population\n\n\n\nImpact on genetic gain: Before genomic selection, a dairy breeding program had:\n\nSelection intensity: i = 2.0\nAccuracy: r = 0.40 (parent average for young bulls)\nGenetic standard deviation: σ_A = 600 kg\nGeneration interval: L = 6 years\n\nAfter implementing genomic selection:\n\nSelection intensity: i = 2.5 (can evaluate more candidates)\nAccuracy: r = 0.65 (genomic predictions)\nGenetic standard deviation: σ_A = 600 kg (unchanged)\nGeneration interval: L = 2.5 years\n\nCalculate the annual genetic gain before and after genomic selection. By what factor did genetic gain increase?",

Terms are listed alphabetically.\nAccuracy (r): Correlation between estimated breeding value (EBV) and true breeding value (TBV). Range: 0 to 1. Higher accuracy means more reliable prediction.\nAdditive genetic effect: The sum of the average effects of alleles at all loci affecting a trait. Determines breeding value and is transmitted to offspring.\nAdditive genetic variance (σ²_A): Variance in breeding values within a population. Determines heritability and response to selection.\nAI (Artificial Insemination): Technique for breeding animals by collecting and depositing semen artificially rather than through natural mating.\nAllele: One of two or more alternative forms of a gene at a specific locus.\nAllele frequency: Proportion of a specific allele in a population. Example: If 70% of alleles at a locus are “A”, the allele frequency of A is 0.70.",
