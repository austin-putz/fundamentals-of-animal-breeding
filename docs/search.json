    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nAnimal breeding is both an ancient art and a modern science. For thousands of years, humans have selected superior animals as parents of the next generation, gradually transforming wild species into the highly productive domestic animals we know today. However, modern animal breeding has evolved far beyond simple selection—it now integrates advanced quantitative genetics, massive databases, sophisticated statistical models, economic analysis, and cutting-edge genomic technologies.\nThis chapter introduces you to the role and tools of today’s animal breeder. You’ll learn that successful breeding programs require a diverse skillset spanning multiple disciplines, from statistics to economics to molecular biology. You’ll discover how breeding companies are structured, how they generate revenue, and how genetics flows from elite nucleus populations to commercial farms. Finally, you’ll see that while the species may differ—swine, poultry, dairy cattle, beef cattle, or even aquaculture—the fundamental principles of genetic improvement remain universal.\nWelcome to the world of modern animal breeding!",

    "section": "\n1.2 1.1 The Universal Science of Genetic Improvement",
    "text": "1.2 1.1 The Universal Science of Genetic Improvement\n\n1.2.1 1.1.1 Defining Animal Breeding\nAt its core, animal breeding has a simple goal:\n\nSelect the best animals to be parents of the next generation.\n\nBut what does “best” mean? And best for what purpose? The answer depends on the breeding objective—the traits we want to improve. For dairy cattle, “best” might mean cows that produce more milk with better fertility and health. For swine, it might mean pigs that grow faster, more efficiently, and produce leaner carcasses. For broiler chickens, it might mean birds that reach market weight quickly with excellent feed conversion.\nThe ultimate goal of animal breeding is more precise:\n\nIncrease the mean genetic merit of a population over time.\n\nThis change in genetic merit over time is called genetic gain or, mathematically, ΔG (delta G, the change in genetic mean). Genetic gain is cumulative—improvements made in one generation are passed to the next, compounding over decades to create dramatic transformations in livestock productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGenetic Gain is Permanent\n\n\n\nUnlike environmental improvements (better nutrition, housing, or management), genetic improvements are permanent and cumulative. Once superior genes are fixed in a population, they remain in future generations. This is why animal breeding creates lasting value.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 1.1.2 Universal Principles\nThe principles you’ll learn in this course—quantitative genetics, selection theory, genetic evaluation, mating strategies—apply universally to all domesticated species:\n\n\nLivestock: Swine, cattle (dairy and beef), sheep, goats\n\nPoultry: Broilers (meat), layers (eggs), turkeys, ducks\n\nAquaculture: Salmon, trout, tilapia, shrimp\n\nCompanion animals: Dogs, cats, horses\n\nEven plants: The same statistical methods and breeding theories apply to crop improvement\n\nNo matter the species, the fundamental challenges are the same:\n\nDefine the breeding objective (what to improve)\nMeasure traits accurately (phenotyping)\nEstimate genetic merit (breeding values)\nSelect superior parents\nDesign optimal matings\nManage genetic diversity\n\nThis universality is powerful. The skills you develop in this course will prepare you for careers across the entire animal agriculture industry—and beyond.\n\n1.2.3 1.1.3 Breeding vs. Production: Changing Genes vs. Changing Environment\nIt’s critical to distinguish between breeding and production management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nBreeding\nProduction\n\n\n\nFocus\nChanging allele frequencies\n\nChanging environment\n\n\n\nTimeframe\nLong-term (generations)\nShort-term (immediate)\n\n\nEffect\nPermanent and cumulative\nTemporary (must be maintained)\n\n\nTools\nSelection, mating, genomics\nNutrition, housing, health management\n\n\nCost\nFront-loaded (data collection, evaluation)\nOngoing (feed, labor, facilities)\n\n\n\nExample: Improving feed efficiency\n\n\nProduction approach: Optimize feed formulation, reduce waste, improve gut health with additives\n\nEffect: Immediate improvement\nDuration: Only while management continues\n\n\n\nBreeding approach: Select animals with superior genetic feed efficiency (low RFI)\n\nEffect: Builds over generations\nDuration: Permanent—efficient genes pass to offspring\n\n\n\nBoth approaches are necessary and complementary, but breeding creates permanent, compounding value that continues long after the initial investment.",

    "text": "1.3 1.2 The Breeder’s Multidisciplinary Skill Set\nModern animal breeding is not a single discipline—it’s an integration of multiple fields. A successful breeder must be part statistician, part biologist, part economist, and part data scientist. Let’s explore the essential skills and why each matters.\n\n1.3.1 1.2.1 Quantitative Genetics & Statistics\nAt the heart of animal breeding lies quantitative genetics—the study of traits controlled by many genes, each with small effects. Most economically important traits (growth rate, milk production, litter size, feed efficiency) are quantitative, not simply inherited.\nKey concepts you’ll master in this course:\n\nHeritability (h²): The proportion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects. Determines how fast we can improve a trait through selection.\nGenetic correlations: How traits are genetically linked. Selecting for one trait (e.g., growth rate) inevitably affects others (e.g., backfat thickness).\nBreeding values: An animal’s genetic merit as a parent. The Estimated Breeding Value (EBV) or Expected Progeny Difference (EPD) is our best guess at an animal’s true genetic merit based on available data.\n\nStatistical models are essential for estimating breeding values:\n\n\nLinear mixed models: Account for fixed effects (e.g., contemporary groups) and random effects (genetic merit)\n\nBest Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP): The gold standard for estimating breeding values, using information from the individual, parents, progeny, and all relatives simultaneously\n\nGenomic prediction models: Incorporate DNA marker information to increase accuracy, especially for young animals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy Statistics?\n\n\n\nPhenotypes (what we observe) are influenced by both genetics and environment. Statistics allows us to partition variation:\n\\[\n\\text{Phenotype} = \\text{Genetics} + \\text{Environment}\n\\]\nOnly by accurately separating genetic from environmental effects can we identify the truly superior animals.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 1.2.2 Databases and Data Management\nBreeding programs generate massive amounts of data:\n\n\nPhenotypes: Birth weights, growth rates, ultrasound measurements, feed intake, reproductive records, health events\n\nPedigrees: Parentage for thousands or millions of animals\n\nGenotypes: SNP chip data (50,000 to 800,000 markers per animal)\n\nManagement data: Contemporary groups, pen assignments, treatment histories\n\nData integrity is paramount. A famous saying in computer science applies perfectly to animal breeding:\n\n“Garbage in, garbage out.”\n\nIf phenotypic data are inaccurate (e.g., swapped IDs, incorrect dates, measurement errors), the genetic evaluations will be flawed, and selection decisions will be wrong.\nRelational databases are the foundation of breeding programs:\n\n\nTables: Animals, Pedigree, Phenotypes, Genotypes\n\nKeys: Unique animal IDs link records across tables\n\nQueries: Extract data for analysis (using SQL)\n\nModern breeders must be comfortable working with databases, performing quality control, and ensuring data flows correctly from field collection to genetic evaluation.\n\n1.3.3 1.2.3 Economics and Economic Value\nNot all genetic improvement is created equal. Improving milk yield by 100 kg is not equally valuable to improving fertility by 5 days to conception—even though both might have similar heritabilities.\nThis is where economics enters breeding:\n\nEconomic weights (v): The value of a one-unit improvement in a trait, holding all others constant. Usually expressed in dollars per unit (e.g., $0.30 per kg of milk, $3 per day reduction in days open).\nSelection indices: Combine multiple traits weighted by their economic values to create a single selection criterion that maximizes profit. Examples: Net Merit (dairy), $W (beef), Sow Productivity Index (swine).\n\nCost-benefit analysis guides breeding decisions:\n\nIs it worth the cost of installing expensive automated feeders to measure individual feed intake, given the genetic gain expected in feed efficiency?\nShould we genotype all selection candidates ($50 per animal) or rely only on pedigree and phenotypes?\n\nBreeders must constantly balance genetic gain against cost, accuracy against speed, and short-term profit against long-term improvement.\n\n1.3.4 1.2.4 Production and Animal Science Knowledge\nAccurate phenotyping—measuring traits correctly—requires deep knowledge of animal biology and production systems:\n\n\nGrowth traits: Proper weighing procedures, accounting for gut fill, standardizing age\n\nCarcass traits: Ultrasound or CT scanning techniques, carcass dissection protocols\n\nReproductive traits: Estrus detection, pregnancy diagnosis, litter recording at birth\n\nFeed efficiency: Electronic feeders (e.g., GrowSafe, FIRE), individual vs. group housing\n\nHealth traits: Disease challenge studies, immune response assays, diagnostic lab results\n\nEnvironmental effects must be understood and modeled:\n\n\nContemporary groups: Animals raised together in the same environment (herd-year-season)\n\nManagement factors: Pen effects, batch effects, parity effects (for reproductive traits)\n\nSeasonal effects: Temperature, day length, feed availability\n\nWithout solid animal science knowledge, breeders cannot collect accurate data or properly account for environmental variation—leading to biased genetic evaluations.",

    "text": "1.4 1.3 The Industry Structure: The Breeding Pyramid\nMost livestock breeding industries are organized as hierarchical pyramid structures. Genetic improvement originates at the top (the nucleus) and flows downward through multiplier levels to the commercial production base. Understanding this structure is key to understanding how breeding programs operate.\n\n1.4.1 1.3.1 The Breeding Pyramid Model\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical structure of a breeding pyramid (e.g., swine). Selection intensity is highest at the nucleus, and genetics flow downward to commercial production.\n\n\n\nThe pyramid has three main levels:\n1. Nucleus (Apex)\n\n\nPopulation: Small, elite group of purebred animals (typically 2,000-10,000 breeding animals)\n\nGoal: Maximize genetic gain through intense selection and advanced technologies\n\nSelection intensity: Highest (top 1-10% selected as parents)\n\nTools: Complete phenotyping, pedigree analysis, genomic selection, progeny testing\n\nOwnership: Genetics companies own and operate nucleus herds/flocks\n\nExamples: - Swine: Genus (PIC, Hypor), Topigs Norsvin nucleus farms with purebred Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Pietrain lines - Poultry: Cobb-Vantress, Aviagen great-grandparent lines (proprietary genetics) - Dairy: Elite bull dams and young genomic sires at AI studs (Select Sires, ABS Global, Alta Genetics)\n2. Multiplier (Middle Tier)\n\n\nPopulation: Larger population (~50,000-500,000 animals) that receives genetics from the nucleus\n\nGoal: Propagate superior genetics, often creating crossbred maternal lines (F₁ females)\n\nSelection intensity: Moderate (primarily for reproductive success, not genetic improvement)\n\nFunction: Expand numbers to supply commercial production\n\nExamples: - Swine: Multiplier farms produce F₁ gilts (Large White × Landrace) that are sold to commercial producers - Poultry: Grandparent and parent stock farms that produce hatching eggs - Dairy: Not applicable (semen disseminated directly via AI)\n3. Commercial (Base)\n\n\nPopulation: Vast (millions to billions of animals globally)\n\nGoal: Maximize production and profit using crossbred genetics from above\n\nSelection intensity: Minimal or none (animals typically slaughtered or culled after production cycle)\n\nFocus: Production management, not genetic improvement\n\nExamples: - Swine: Commercial sow farms using F₁ gilts mated to terminal sires (Duroc, Pietrain) to produce market hogs - Poultry: Commercial broiler farms raising chickens from 1 day to ~42 days (slaughter) - Dairy: Commercial dairy farms using semen from elite bulls\n\n1.4.2 1.3.2 Species-Specific Pyramids\nSwine: A Classic Three-Tier Pyramid\nThe swine industry exemplifies the pyramid structure:\nNucleus → Purebred lines (Large White, Landrace, Duroc, Pietrain) maintained by genetics companies\nMultiplier → Produces F₁ crossbred gilts: - (Large White ♂ × Landrace ♀) → F₁ gilt (maternal line, excellent reproductive traits)\nCommercial → F₁ gilts mated to terminal sire: - (F₁ ♀ × Duroc ♂) → Market pigs (three-way cross, optimized for growth and carcass)\nGenetic flow: One-directional, from nucleus → multiplier → commercial\nKey companies: - Genus (PIC, Hypor): ~$500M annual revenue - Topigs Norsvin: European leader, cooperative structure - Genesus: Smaller but growing, direct-to-farm model\nPoultry: Four-Tier Proprietary Genetics\nPoultry (broilers and layers) use a four-tier structure with proprietary synthetic lines (not breed-based):\nGreat-Grandparent (GGP) → Elite nucleus lines (pure lines A, B, C, D)\nGrandparent (GP) → Crosses of pure lines (AB × CD)\nParent Stock (PS) → Commercial layer that produces hatching eggs\nCommercial → Broilers (slaughter at ~6 weeks) or layers (egg production)\nOwnership: Highly concentrated—3-4 companies control ~90% of global broiler genetics: - Cobb-Vantress (Tyson Foods): ~40% market share - Aviagen (EW Group): ~35% market share - Hubbard (Groupe Grimaud): ~15% - Hybrid Turkeys (Hendrix Genetics): Turkeys\nGenetic flow: Strictly controlled through contracts; multiplier farms cannot breed their own replacements.\nDairy: AI-Based Dissemination\nDairy cattle breeding does not follow a strict pyramid—instead, it relies on artificial insemination (AI) to disseminate elite bull genetics globally.\nElite nucleus → Bull dams and young genomic sires selected through progeny testing or genomic evaluation\nAI studs → Collect, process, and distribute semen from proven or genomic bulls\nCommercial farms → Use AI to breed cows, selecting bulls based on Net Merit index or other breeding goals\nKey companies: - Select Sires: US cooperative, farmer-owned - ABS Global: Private, international - Alta Genetics: Canadian cooperative - CRV: Dutch cooperative\nGenetic flow: Primarily through semen; some embryo transfer (ET) for elite females.\nBeef: Seedstock Producers and Breed Associations\nBeef cattle breeding is more decentralized:\nSeedstock producers → Registered purebred herds (Angus, Hereford, Simmental, etc.), focus on selling breeding stock (bulls, heifers) and semen\nCommercial cow-calf operations → Purchase bulls or semen from seedstock producers, often crossbreed for hybrid vigor\nBreed associations → Perform genetic evaluations, publish EPDs (Expected Progeny Differences), maintain registries\nKey organizations: - American Angus Association: Largest beef breed registry (~300,000 members) - Red Angus Association of America - Simmental, Hereford, Charolais breed associations\nGenetic flow: Bulls and semen from seedstock producers → commercial herds.\n\n1.4.3 1.3.3 The Role of Artificial Insemination (AI)\nArtificial insemination is the most important technology for disseminating superior male genetics:\nHow AI Works\n\n\nSemen collection: Males trained to mount dummy or live female; semen collected via artificial vagina\n\nEvaluation: Sperm count, motility, morphology assessed\n\nExtension and dilution: Semen diluted with extender (nutrients, antibiotics, cryoprotectant)\n\nFreezing: Packaged in straws (0.5 mL or 0.25 mL), frozen in liquid nitrogen (-196°C)\n\nStorage: Indefinite storage in liquid nitrogen tanks\n\nDistribution: Shipped globally to farms, thawed at point of use\n\nInsemination: Deposited into female reproductive tract (cervix or uterus) at optimal time\nImpact of AI\nAI dramatically increases the selection intensity for males:\n\n\nWithout AI: A bull might sire 20-50 calves per year (natural mating)\n\nWith AI: A single ejaculate can produce hundreds of doses; elite bulls sire thousands to tens of thousands of offspring globally\n\nExample: A top Holstein bull may have &gt;100,000 daughters worldwide, allowing extremely accurate progeny testing (before genomics) or validation of genomic predictions.\nAI by Species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAI Adoption Rate\nPrimary Use\n\n\n\nDairy cattle\n&gt;90% (USA, Europe)\nNearly universal for breeding\n\n\nBeef cattle\n~10-15% (USA)\nMainly seedstock herds; natural mating common in commercial herds\n\n\nSwine\n&gt;95% (commercial)\nStandard practice; boar studs supply semen\n\n\nPoultry\n&lt;5%\nNatural mating predominates (roosters kept with hens)\n\n\nSheep\n5-10%\nSeasonal breeding, labor-intensive",

    "text": "1.6 1.5 The Central Process: Selection and Evaluation\nAt the heart of every breeding program lies a systematic process for identifying and selecting superior animals. Let’s walk through the steps.\n\n1.6.1 1.5.1 Step 1: Defining the Breeding Objective\nThe first critical question: What traits should we improve?\nThis depends on: - Market demands: What do customers value? (lean meat, milk components, egg size, growth rate) - Production costs: What drives profitability? (feed efficiency, reproductive rate, health) - Sustainability goals: Environmental impact, animal welfare\nCommon breeding objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nKey Traits in Breeding Objective\n\n\n\nSwine\nGrowth rate, feed efficiency, litter size, carcass leanness, meat quality\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight at 42 days, feed conversion, breast meat yield, leg health\n\n\nLayers\nEgg production, egg weight, shell quality, feed efficiency, mortality\n\n\nDairy\nMilk yield, milk fat %, milk protein %, fertility, udder health, longevity\n\n\nBeef\nWeaning weight, yearling weight, carcass weight, marbling, tenderness, calving ease\n\n\n\nMost breeding programs target 5-15 traits simultaneously, requiring multi-trait selection (covered in Chapter 9).\n\n1.6.2 1.5.2 Step 2: Phenotyping and Data Acquisition\nPhenotyping is the process of accurately measuring traits on individual animals or groups.\nChallenges in Phenotyping\n\n\nCost: Automated feeders for individual feed intake cost $50,000-$100,000+ per pen\n\nTime: Some traits (e.g., longevity) require years to measure\n\nInvasiveness: Carcass traits require slaughter; some health traits require biopsies or blood samples\n\nAccuracy: Measurement error reduces heritability and slows genetic gain\nModern Phenotyping Technologies\n\n\nAutomated feeders (e.g., GrowSafe, FIRE): Measure individual feed intake in group-housed pigs or cattle\n\nWalk-over-weighing (WOW): Automatic scales record weights as animals pass through\n\nUltrasound: Non-invasive carcass trait measurement (backfat, loin depth)\n\nCT/MRI scanning: High-resolution carcass composition in live animals\n\nMilking robots: Automatically record milk yield, components, and milking speed per cow\n\nAutomated egg counters: Track individual hen production via RFID nest boxes\n\nWearable sensors: Activity monitors, rumination sensors, estrus detection collars\n\nLab assays: Immune response, metabolic profiles, gene expression\n\nExample: Swine feed efficiency (Residual Feed Intake, RFI)\n\n\nTraditional: Hand-feeding, weighing back refused feed → labor-intensive, inaccurate\n\nModern: Electronic RFID feeders record each pig’s daily feed intake automatically over 8-12 weeks → accurate, high-throughput\n\n\n1.6.3 1.5.3 Step 3: Genetic Evaluation (Estimating Breeding Values)\nOnce phenotypes are collected, we must estimate genetic merit for each animal.\nWhy Not Just Select on Phenotype?\nPhenotype = Genetics + Environment\nAn animal with a high phenotype might: - Be genetically superior (we want to select this animal) - Be in a favorable environment (e.g., best pen, best management) - Have favorable non-additive effects (dominance, epistasis) that don’t pass to offspring\nWe need to separate genetic from environmental effects and estimate each animal’s breeding value.\nEstimated Breeding Values (EBVs)\nThe breeding value is the sum of the additive effects of an animal’s genes. It represents genetic merit as a parent.\nThe Estimated Breeding Value (EBV) is our statistical prediction of true breeding value based on: - The animal’s own phenotype - Phenotypes of relatives (parents, siblings, offspring) - Pedigree information - Genomic information (DNA markers)\nModern methods: - BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction): Uses linear mixed models to estimate breeding values, accounting for fixed effects (contemporary groups) and relationships among all animals - Genomic BLUP (GBLUP): Incorporates SNP chip data to improve accuracy, especially for young animals without phenotypes\nWe’ll cover EBV estimation in detail in Chapter 7.\n\n1.6.4 1.5.4 Step 4: Introduction to Genomic Selection\nTraditional selection relied on: - Own performance: Requires waiting for the animal to mature and have phenotypes - Progeny testing: Requires waiting for offspring to be born and measured (slow!)\nGenomic selection changed everything:\nBy genotyping animals with SNP chips (DNA arrays measuring 50,000-800,000 genetic markers), we can: - Predict breeding values at birth (or even as embryos) - Increase accuracy for traits that are expensive to measure (e.g., feed efficiency, carcass quality, disease resistance) - Reduce generation interval (time between generations) by selecting young animals\nImpact: - Dairy: Generation interval reduced from ~6 years (progeny testing) to ~2.5 years (genomic selection) → doubled rate of genetic gain - Swine: Enabled selection for feed efficiency (RFI) without phenotyping all candidates - Poultry: High accuracy for traits like disease resistance and leg health\nWe’ll explore genomic selection in Chapters 12-13.",

Now we turn to the practical foundation of every breeding program: What are we actually trying to improve, and how do we measure it?\nImagine you’re a geneticist at a swine breeding company. Your team has been tasked with improving growth rate in your terminal sire line. This sounds straightforward—select faster-growing pigs as parents. But as you’ll discover in this chapter, this seemingly simple goal raises many critical questions:\n\n\nWhat trait exactly should we measure? Body weight at a specific age? Average daily gain over a period? Weight at a target backfat depth?\n\nHow do we measure it accurately? Manual weighing? Automated scales? How often?\n\nHow do we record and manage the data? What if an ID tag is misread or a weight is entered incorrectly?\n\nIs growth rate the only thing that matters? What about feed efficiency, carcass quality, leg soundness, or meat quality?\n\nHow do we know which pigs are genetically superior vs. just raised in a better environment?\n\nThis chapter addresses these foundational questions. We’ll explore:\n\n\nTraits of economic importance: The characteristics that drive profitability in livestock production\n\nPhenotypes and phenotyping: What we observe and how we measure it accurately\n\nData recording and management: The critical infrastructure that makes breeding programs work\n\nBreeding objectives: Defining what traits to improve and their relative importance\n\nTrue Breeding Value (TBV): The concept of genetic merit that underpins all selection decisions\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you’ll understand that successful animal breeding depends not just on sophisticated statistical models (which we’ll cover in later chapters), but on high-quality data collected systematically over time. As the saying goes: “Garbage in, garbage out.” Without accurate phenotypes and clear breeding objectives, no amount of statistical wizardry can produce genetic progress.\nLet’s begin by exploring the traits that matter in livestock breeding.",

    "text": "2.2 Traits of Economic Importance\nNot all traits are created equal when it comes to livestock breeding. Some traits directly determine revenue (milk sold, eggs produced, carcass weight), while others affect costs (feed consumption, veterinary treatments, mortality). Still others influence long-term sustainability (longevity, welfare, environmental impact).\nTraits of economic importance can be organized into six major categories. As we explore each category, notice how the same principles apply across species, but the specific traits and their relative importance vary by production system.\n\n2.2.1 2.1 Production Traits\nProduction traits are the most visible and often the most emphasized—they directly determine the quantity of product (meat, milk, eggs) an animal produces.\nGrowth Rate\nGrowth rate measures how quickly an animal gains body weight over time. It’s critical for meat-producing species where animals are raised to a target market weight.\nCommon measurements:\n\nAverage Daily Gain (ADG): Body weight gain per day over a defined period \\[\\text{ADG} = \\frac{\\text{Final Weight} - \\text{Initial Weight}}{\\text{Days on Test}}\\]\nBody weight at fixed age: E.g., broiler weight at 42 days, pig weight at 150 days\n\nSpecies-specific examples:\n\n\nSpecies\nTrait\nTypical Range\nUnits\n\n\n\nSwine\nADG from 25-110 kg\n800-1,000 g/day\ng/day\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight at 42 days\n2.4-2.8 kg\nkg\n\n\nBeef cattle\nWeaning weight (adjusted 205d)\n180-250 kg\nkg\n\n\nBeef cattle\nYearling weight (adjusted 365d)\n350-450 kg\nkg\n\n\nLayers\nBody weight at 18 weeks\n1.3-1.5 kg\nkg\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: Faster growth means: - Shorter time to market (reduced facility and labor costs) - More production cycles per year - Greater throughput and revenue\nHowever, there can be trade-offs: Extremely fast growth can lead to leg problems (broilers), increased backfat (swine), or metabolic issues.\nMilk Yield\nFor dairy cattle, milk production is the primary revenue-generating trait.\nMeasurement: - 305-day lactation yield: Total milk produced in first 305 days of lactation (kg) - Test-day records: Monthly milk weights via DHI (Dairy Herd Improvement) testing or daily via automated milking systems\nTypical values: - Elite Holsteins: 10,000-14,000 kg per 305-day lactation - Average Holsteins (USA): ~10,000 kg - Jersey cattle: 6,000-8,000 kg (but higher components)\nEconomic importance: At $0.35-0.45 per kg milk, a cow producing 1,000 kg more per lactation generates $350-450 extra revenue.\nHowever, genetic selection for extremely high milk yield has been associated with: - Reduced fertility (longer days open, lower conception rates) - Increased metabolic disorders (ketosis, displaced abomasum) - Shorter productive life (more culling)\nThis is why modern breeding objectives balance milk yield with health and fertility (more on this in Section 2.5).\nEgg Production\nFor laying hens, the number of eggs produced over the hen’s productive life determines revenue.\nMeasurement: - Eggs per hen housed: Total eggs from point of housing (e.g., 18 weeks) to end of lay cycle (e.g., 80 weeks) - Peak production: Maximum eggs per 100 hens per day (e.g., 95-98%) - Persistency: Maintenance of production after peak\nTypical values: - Modern commercial layers: 320-350 eggs per hen housed (18-80 weeks) - Peak rates: 95-98 eggs per 100 hens per day\nEconomic importance: At $0.10-0.15 per egg (farm gate), an extra 20 eggs per hen = $2.00-3.00 additional revenue per hen.\nEgg production is highly heritable (h² ≈ 0.25-0.35), making it responsive to selection. However, breeders must also consider: - Egg weight: Larger eggs have premium value but may reduce total egg numbers - Shell quality: Cracked eggs are unsellable - Feed efficiency: Feed costs dominate layer economics\nFeed Intake\nWhile not a traditional “production” trait, feed intake is measured extensively because it’s necessary for calculating feed efficiency (Section 2.4).\nMeasurement: - Daily feed intake (kg/day or g/day) - Cumulative feed intake over test period\nTechnologies: - Electronic feeders: FIRE systems (swine), GrowSafe (cattle), automated poultry feeders - RFID-enabled: Each animal identified when accessing feeder, intake recorded automatically\nTypical values: - Growing-finishing pigs (25-110 kg): 1.8-2.5 kg/day - Dairy cows (lactating): 20-28 kg dry matter/day - Broilers (1-42 days): Cumulative ~3.5-4.5 kg - Beef steers (feedlot): 10-14 kg dry matter/day\n\n2.2.2 2.2 Reproductive Traits\nReproductive traits determine how many offspring an animal produces over its lifetime. These traits are economically critical but present unique breeding challenges—they typically have low heritability (h² &lt; 0.15) and are often sex-limited (expressed only in one sex).\nLitter Size (Swine)\nLitter size measures the number of offspring born per litter in polytocous species (those that produce multiple offspring).\nCommon measurements: - Total born (TB): Total piglets born (alive + stillborn) - Number born alive (NBA): Live piglets at birth - Number weaned (NW): Piglets surviving to weaning (~21 days)\nTypical values (modern commercial sows): - Total born: 13-16 piglets - Born alive: 12-14 piglets - Weaned: 11-13 piglets\nEconomic importance: At $50 per weaned pig, one extra pig weaned per litter × 2.3 litters per sow per year = $115 extra revenue per sow per year.\nBreeding challenge: Litter size has very low heritability (h² ≈ 0.10-0.15), meaning: - Most variation is environmental (sow condition, nutrition, management) - Genetic progress is slow - Requires large datasets and accurate pedigrees - Genomic selection helps increase accuracy\nFertility\nFertility encompasses the ability to conceive and maintain pregnancy.\nCommon measurements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nTrait\nDefinition\nTypical Value\n\n\n\nDairy\nDaughter Pregnancy Rate (DPR)\n% pregnant per 21-day cycle\n18-25%\n\n\nDairy\nDays Open\nDays from calving to conception\n100-150 days\n\n\nBeef\nHeifer Pregnancy (HP)\n% heifers pregnant at ~14 months\n85-95%\n\n\nBeef\nFirst Service Conception Rate\n% pregnant after first insemination\n50-65%\n\n\nSwine\nFarrowing rate\n% of mated sows that farrow\n85-90%\n\n\nLayers\nSexual maturity\nAge at first egg\n18-20 weeks\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: - Dairy: Each extra day open costs ~$3-5 (delayed lactation, increased breeding costs) - Beef: Open cows generate no calf crop and still incur maintenance costs\nHeritability: Generally low (h² ≈ 0.03-0.10 for most fertility traits), making improvement difficult but not impossible with genomic selection and large datasets.\nCalving/Farrowing Ease\nDystocia (difficult birth) causes calf/piglet mortality, maternal injury, and increased labor.\nMeasurement: - Calving ease score: 1 (unassisted) to 5 (extreme difficulty, caesarean section) - Birth weight: Often used as predictor (heavier calves/piglets → more dystocia) - Percentage unassisted births\nTypical values: - Beef cattle: 85-95% unassisted births (heifers lower) - Dairy: 90-95% unassisted births - Swine: Farrowing duration, stillborn rate (indicator)\nHeritability: - Direct calving ease (calf’s effect): h² ≈ 0.05-0.15 - Maternal calving ease (cow’s pelvic capacity): h² ≈ 0.10-0.20\nBreeding strategy: Select terminal sires with negative EPD for birth weight (smaller, easier-born calves), especially for use on heifers.\n\n2.2.3 2.3 Health and Fitness Traits\nHealth traits are increasingly important in breeding programs as producers, consumers, and regulators focus on animal welfare and reducing antibiotic use.\nDisease Resistance\nDisease resistance measures an animal’s ability to avoid infection or minimize disease severity.\nExamples by species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nDisease\nMeasurement\nHeritability\n\n\n\nDairy\nMastitis\nSomatic Cell Score (SCC)\nh² ≈ 0.10-0.15\n\n\nDairy\nLameness\nMobility score, foot lesions\nh² ≈ 0.05-0.15\n\n\nSwine\nPRRS resistance\nViremia, weight loss\nh² ≈ 0.15-0.30\n\n\nPoultry\nNewcastle disease\nAntibody titer, mortality\nh² ≈ 0.10-0.30\n\n\nSalmon\nIPN (infectious pancreatic necrosis)\nSurvival post-challenge\nh² ≈ 0.15-0.40\n\n\n\nMeasurement challenges: - Disease challenge tests: Expensive, require controlled exposure - Natural disease incidence: Depends on pathogen exposure (environmental) - Genomic selection: Increasingly used for disease traits (identify resistant genotypes without challenge)\nEconomic importance: - Mastitis (dairy): ~$200-300 per case (treatment, milk loss, culling) - PRRS (swine): ~$5-10 per pig in mortality, reduced growth - Diseases reduce animal welfare and necessitate antibiotic use\nLongevity and Stayability\nLongevity measures how long an animal remains productive in the herd.\nCommon measurements: - Productive life (dairy): Months from first calving to culling - Stayability (beef): Probability cow remains in herd to age 6, having weaned 5+ calves - Survival (poultry): Mortality rate from housing to end of lay\nTypical values: - Dairy: Average productive life ~2.5-3.5 lactations (goal: &gt;4) - Beef: Stayability to age 6: ~60-75% - Layers: Mortality 18-80 weeks: 3-8%\nEconomic importance: - Dairy: Each extra lactation = ~$500-1,000 saved (replacement cost, calf value) - Beef: Cows that stay in herd longer amortize their development costs over more calves\nHeritability: Low to moderate (h² ≈ 0.05-0.15), but selection indices increasingly include longevity due to its economic impact.\n\n2.2.4 2.4 Efficiency Traits\nEfficiency traits measure how effectively animals convert inputs (primarily feed) into outputs (meat, milk, eggs). With feed representing 60-70% of production costs, efficiency is economically critical.\nFeed Efficiency: RFI vs. FCR\nThere are two main ways to express feed efficiency:\n1. Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)\n\\[\\text{FCR} = \\frac{\\text{Feed Intake}}{\\text{Body Weight Gain}}\\]\n\n\nLower FCR is better (less feed per kg gain)\nTypical values:\n\n\nBroilers: 1.5-1.8 kg feed per kg gain\n\nSwine: 2.4-2.8 kg feed per kg gain\n\nBeef cattle: 5.5-7.5 kg feed per kg gain\n\n\n\nLimitation: FCR is confounded with growth rate. Fast-growing animals naturally have better FCR (less feed for maintenance per kg gain).\n2. Residual Feed Intake (RFI)\nRFI is the difference between an animal’s actual feed intake and its expected feed intake based on body weight and gain.\n\\[\\text{RFI} = \\text{Actual Feed Intake} - \\text{Expected Feed Intake}\\]\n\n\nNegative RFI is better (eats less than expected for its size and growth)\n\nRFI is independent of growth rate (you can select for low RFI without reducing growth)\n\nExample (swine): - Pig A: Grows 900 g/day, eats 2.0 kg/day → Expected intake: 2.1 kg/day → RFI = 2.0 - 2.1 = -0.1 kg/day (efficient!) - Pig B: Grows 900 g/day, eats 2.4 kg/day → Expected intake: 2.1 kg/day → RFI = 2.4 - 2.1 = +0.3 kg/day (inefficient)\nHeritability: - FCR: h² ≈ 0.25-0.40 - RFI: h² ≈ 0.30-0.45\nWhy measure RFI? RFI is more expensive to measure (requires individual feed intake), but it allows: - Selection for efficiency without reducing growth - Improved profitability: Reducing RFI by 0.1 kg/day = ~5-8 kg less feed per pig (~$2-3 saved)\nPartial Efficiency Traits\n\n\nFeed per kg milk (dairy): kg dry matter intake per kg milk produced\n\nFeed per dozen eggs (layers): kg feed per 12 eggs\n\nResidual energy intake (dairy): Similar to RFI, accounting for milk production and body weight change\n\n2.2.5 2.5 Quality Traits\nQuality traits determine product value—consumers and processors pay premiums for higher-quality products.\nCarcass Composition (Meat Animals)\nKey traits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nSpecies\nMeasurement\nTypical Range\n\n\n\nBackfat depth\nSwine\nUltrasound, carcass\n10-18 mm\n\n\nLoin depth\nSwine\nUltrasound, carcass\n50-70 mm\n\n\nMarbling score\nBeef\nVisual, camera grading\n3-8 (USDA scale)\n\n\nRibeye area\nBeef\nCarcass measurement\n75-95 cm²\n\n\nBreast meat yield\nBroilers\nProcessing plant data\n21-26% of live weight\n\n\nPercent lean\nSwine\nCalculated from carcass\n55-62%\n\n\n\nEconomic importance: - Swine: Each mm less backfat = ~$0.50-1.00 per carcass (leaner = higher value) - Beef: Marbling score increase (Choice to Prime) = $50-150 premium per carcass - Broilers: 1% increase in breast yield = ~$0.05-0.10 per bird\nHeritability: Moderate to high (h² ≈ 0.30-0.60), making carcass traits highly responsive to selection.\nMilk Components (Dairy)\nMilk is priced based on component content, not just volume.\nKey traits: - Fat %: Typically 3.5-4.5% in Holsteins, 4.5-6.0% in Jerseys - Protein %: Typically 3.0-3.5% in Holsteins, 3.5-4.0% in Jerseys - Fat yield (kg): Total kg fat = % × milk yield - Protein yield (kg): Total kg protein = % × milk yield\nEconomic importance: Milk payment formulas often reward components more than volume. Example: - $0.30 per kg milk + $2.50 per kg fat + $4.00 per kg protein\nGenetic correlations: - Milk yield vs. fat%: Negative (r_A ≈ -0.3 to -0.5) — selecting for volume reduces % - Milk yield vs. fat kg: Positive (r_A ≈ +0.5 to +0.7) — more volume = more total fat - Fat% vs. protein%: Positive (r_A ≈ +0.6) — tend to move together\nEgg Quality (Layers)\nKey traits: - Egg weight: 55-65 g (premium for larger eggs, but size must fit carton) - Shell strength: Breaking force (kg), shell thickness (mm) - Shell color: Brown vs. white (market preference, no quality difference) - Internal quality: Albumin height, Haugh units (measure of freshness) - Yolk color: Fan score (1-15), driven by diet and genetics\nEconomic importance: - Cracked eggs: 6-10% loss; shell strength reduces cracks - Egg size: Premium for large/extra-large grades\nHeritability: Generally moderate to high (h² ≈ 0.30-0.60 for most egg quality traits).\nMeat Quality\n\n\npH: Ultimate pH (pHu) after rigor mortis — affects water-holding capacity, color\n\n\nSwine: Normal pHu = 5.6-5.8; PSE (pale, soft, exudative) if &lt; 5.4\n\n\n\nColor: L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness) — consumer preference for darker red meat\n\nTenderness: Warner-Bratzler shear force (lower = more tender) — major quality factor in beef\n\nIntramuscular fat: Marbling — associated with tenderness, flavor, juiciness\n\nHeritability: Moderate (h² ≈ 0.20-0.50 for most meat quality traits).\n\n2.2.6 2.6 Welfare Traits\nAnimal welfare is increasingly important to consumers, retailers, and regulations. Welfare traits are challenging to define and measure but are entering breeding programs.\nTemperament and Behavior\nMeasurement: - Temperament scores: Docility during handling (1 = calm, 5 = aggressive) - Flight speed: Time to exit a chute (cattle) — faster = more excitable - Fear response: Tonic immobility test (poultry), open field test\nTypical heritability: h² ≈ 0.10-0.40 depending on trait and measurement method\nEconomic importance: - Cattle: Calm temperament improves safety for handlers, reduces stress-induced weight loss - Swine: Aggressive pigs cause injuries, tail biting - Poultry: Feather pecking and cannibalism reduce welfare and productivity\nLeg and Foot Health\nLeg problems are a major welfare concern, especially in fast-growing broilers and high-producing dairy cows.\nExamples: - Broilers: Leg scores (gait analysis, 0 = normal to 5 = severe lameness) - Dairy: Locomotion scores (1 = sound to 5 = severely lame) - Swine: Leg soundness, osteochondrosis\nHeritability: Low to moderate (h² ≈ 0.05-0.20)\nSelection challenge: Leg problems are often genetically correlated with production traits: - Broilers: Fast growth → heavier body weight → increased leg stress - Dairy: High milk yield → increased metabolic stress → increased lameness risk\nModern breeding programs use multi-trait selection to balance production with leg health.\nAbsence of Genetic Defects\nSome welfare issues are caused by deleterious recessive alleles. Examples: - Cattle: Hypotrichosis (hairlessness), chondrodysplasia (dwarfism) - Dogs: Hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, brachycephalic syndrome\nBreeding strategy: - DNA testing: Identify carriers of recessive alleles - Mating strategies: Avoid carrier × carrier matings (produces affected offspring) - Selection against carriers: Gradually reduce allele frequency\n\n2.2.7 2.7 Summary Table: Key Traits by Species\nThe table below summarizes economically important traits across major livestock species, providing typical values and approximate heritabilities. These values will become more meaningful as we cover heritability in detail in Chapter 5.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Economically important traits in major livestock species\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nSpecies\nTrait\nTypical Value\nHeritability (h²)\n\n\n\nProduction\nSwine\nADG (25-110 kg)\n850-950 g/d\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nDairy\n305-d milk yield\n10,000 kg\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nBeef\nWeaning weight\n220 kg\n0.30-0.40\n\n\n\nBroilers\nBody weight (42d)\n2.6 kg\n0.30-0.50\n\n\n\nLayers\nEggs/hen (18-80 wk)\n330 eggs\n0.25-0.35\n\n\nReproduction\nSwine\nNBA (born alive)\n12-14 pigs\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nDairy\nDaughter pregnancy rate\n20%\n0.03-0.05\n\n\n\nBeef\nHeifer pregnancy\n90%\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nLayers\nAge at first egg\n19 wk\n0.40-0.50\n\n\nHealth/Fitness\nDairy\nSomatic cell score\n3.0-3.5\n0.10-0.15\n\n\n\nSwine\nPRRS resistance\nVariable\n0.15-0.30\n\n\n\nBroilers\nLeg soundness score\n1.5 (0-5 scale)\n0.05-0.20\n\n\nEfficiency\nSwine\nRFI (feed efficiency)\n-0.05 kg/d\n0.30-0.45\n\n\n\nBeef\nRFI (feedlot)\n-0.2 kg/d\n0.30-0.45\n\n\n\nLayers\nFeed per dozen eggs\n1.6 kg\n0.25-0.40\n\n\nQuality\nSwine\nBackfat depth\n12 mm\n0.40-0.60\n\n\n\nBeef\nMarbling score\n5.5 (3-8 scale)\n0.35-0.50\n\n\n\nLayers\nEgg weight\n62 g\n0.50-0.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy Heritability Matters\n\n\n\nHeritability (h²) is the proportion of phenotypic variation due to additive genetic effects (Chapter 5). Key takeaways:\n\n\nHigh heritability (h² &gt; 0.40): Traits respond quickly to selection (growth, carcass, egg weight)\n\nModerate heritability (h² = 0.20-0.40): Steady progress possible (milk yield, feed efficiency)\n\nLow heritability (h² &lt; 0.20): Slow progress, requires large datasets and genomic tools (fertility, disease resistance)\n\nNotice that reproductive and health traits typically have low heritability—this is why modern breeding increasingly relies on genomic selection to improve accuracy for these difficult traits.",

    "text": "2.3 Phenotypes and Phenotyping\nNow that we’ve identified what traits matter, we turn to the practical challenge of measuring them accurately. This process—called phenotyping—is the foundation of all genetic improvement. Without high-quality phenotypes, genetic evaluations will be biased, selection decisions will be wrong, and genetic progress will stall.\nAs you’ll see in this section, phenotyping is far more than simply “weighing a pig” or “counting eggs.” It requires careful attention to measurement protocols, equipment calibration, data recording, and quality control.\n\n2.3.1 3.1 What is a Phenotype?\nA phenotype is any observable or measurable characteristic of an organism. In animal breeding, phenotypes are the traits we record on individual animals—body weight, milk yield, egg production, backfat depth, disease incidence, temperament, and so on.\nDefinition:\n\nPhenotype: The observable expression of an animal’s genotype in a specific environment.\n\nMathematically, we can express the phenotype as:\n\\[P = G + E\\]\nWhere: - P = Phenotype (what we observe and measure) - G = Genotype (genetic contribution, sum of all genetic effects) - E = Environment (all non-genetic factors: nutrition, management, health, weather, measurement error)\nWe’ll formalize this model in Chapter 3 by partitioning the genetic component (\\(G\\)) into additive, dominance, and epistatic effects. For now, the key insight is that phenotype ≠ genotype. An animal with a high phenotype may be:\n\n\nGenetically superior (large \\(G\\))\n\nIn a favorable environment (large positive \\(E\\))\nBoth\n\nLucky (random environmental advantage)\n\nExample: Two pigs, both weighing 110 kg at 150 days of age\n\n\nPig A: Comes from a genetically superior line (parents had high EBVs), raised in average conditions\n\n\n\\(G\\) = high, \\(E\\) = average → \\(P\\) = 110 kg\n\n\n\nPig B: Comes from average parents (moderate EBVs), raised in exceptionally favorable conditions (best pen, extra feeding attention)\n\n\n\\(G\\) = average, \\(E\\) = high → \\(P\\) = 110 kg\n\n\n\nBoth pigs have identical phenotypes (110 kg), but Pig A is the better breeding animal because its phenotype reflects superior genetics, not just favorable environment. The challenge of animal breeding is to estimate \\(G\\) from \\(P\\), which requires accounting for environmental variation.\n\n2.3.2 3.2 Measurement Accuracy and Precision\nNot all phenotypic measurements are created equal. The quality of phenotypic data depends on two distinct properties: accuracy and precision.\nAccuracy\nAccuracy measures how close a measurement is to the true value.\n\n\nHigh accuracy: Measurements are close to the true value on average\n\nLow accuracy: Measurements are systematically biased (e.g., scale consistently reads 2 kg too high)\n\nSources of inaccuracy: - Uncalibrated equipment (scales, ultrasound machines) - Systematic measurement errors (always weighing pigs in the afternoon when gut fill is higher) - Observer bias (subjective scoring)\nPrecision\nPrecision measures the repeatability of measurements—how close repeated measurements are to each other.\n\n\nHigh precision: Repeated measurements give similar results\n\nLow precision: Repeated measurements vary widely\n\nSources of imprecision: - Measurement error (animal movement during weighing, variable ultrasound probe placement) - Temporal variation (weighing at different times of day) - Observer variation (different technicians scoring the same animal differently)\nThe Target Analogy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Accuracy vs. precision illustrated as target shooting. In animal breeding, we strive for high accuracy and high precision (top-left quadrant).\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters in breeding:\n\nAccuracy: Biased measurements lead to biased EBVs and incorrect selection decisions. For example, if a scale always reads 5 kg too high, pigs weighed on that scale appear genetically superior when they’re not.\nPrecision: Imprecise measurements inflate the environmental variance (\\(\\sigma^2_E\\)), which reduces the effective heritability and slows genetic progress.\n\nGoal: Breeding programs strive for high accuracy and high precision—measurements that are both correct on average and repeatable.\n\n2.3.3 3.3 Challenges in Phenotyping Livestock\nAccurate phenotyping is often the most expensive and time-consuming aspect of a breeding program. Let’s explore the main challenges.\nCost\nModern phenotyping technologies can be prohibitively expensive:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\nPurpose\nApproximate Cost\n\n\n\n\nElectronic feeder (FIRE system, swine)\nIndividual feed intake\n$50,000-$100,000+ per pen (10-12 pigs)\n\n\n\nGrowSafe feeder (cattle)\nIndividual feed intake\n$60,000-$120,000 per pen\n\n\n\nAutomated milking system (dairy)\nMilk yield, components, health\n$150,000-$250,000 per robot\n\n\n\nUltrasound machine (carcass)\nBackfat, loin depth\n$15,000-$40,000\n\n\nCT/MRI scanner\nHigh-resolution carcass composition\n$500,000-$2,000,000+\n\n\nGenomic SNP chip\nGenotyping for genomic selection\n$30-$150 per animal\n\n\n\nTrade-off: Companies must balance the cost of phenotyping against the genetic gain achieved by having more accurate data. For example:\n\nInstalling electronic feeders to measure feed efficiency costs ~$5,000-8,000 per pig phenotyped\nBut selecting for RFI can save $2-4 per market pig in feed costs\nWith millions of market pigs produced annually, the investment pays off over time\nTime\nSome traits require months or years to measure:\n\n\nLongevity (dairy): Requires cows to complete multiple lactations (4-8 years)\n\nStayability (beef): Requires cows to reach age 6 and wean multiple calves\n\nFeed efficiency (RFI): Requires 8-12 weeks of daily intake records per animal\n\nCarcass traits: Require slaughter (can’t select the best animals—they’re dead!)\n\nSolution: Use correlated traits measured earlier or on relatives: - Ultrasound carcass traits on live animals (correlated with actual carcass) - Genomic selection (predict EBVs using DNA markers, no need to wait for phenotypes) - Progeny testing (measure trait on relatives, not the selection candidate)\nInvasiveness\nSome phenotypes require invasive or destructive procedures:\n\n\nCarcass traits: Require slaughter\n\nInternal organs: Require necropsy (research context, disease resistance studies)\n\nBlood samples: Immune assays, metabolic profiles\n\nBiopsies: Muscle samples for meat quality analysis\n\nInvasive phenotypes are often measured on a subset of animals (progeny, siblings), and their information is used to predict breeding values for the live selection candidates via genetic relationships.\nThroughput\nManual phenotyping is labor-intensive and limits the number of animals that can be measured:\n\n\nManual milk recording (dairy): Technician records each cow’s milk yield (slow, only monthly)\n\nTrap nests (layers): Manually identify which hen laid which egg (labor-intensive)\n\nCarcass dissection: Extremely time-consuming, limited to research settings\n\nSolution: Automation dramatically increases throughput: - Milking robots: Record every cow, every milking (2-3× per day) - RFID nest boxes: Automatically detect which hen enters each nest - Camera-based phenotyping: Automated body condition scoring, weight estimation (Chapter 25)\n\n2.3.4 3.4 Examples by Species\nLet’s explore how major livestock species phenotype their most important traits, highlighting the technologies and challenges involved.\nSwine Breeding\nGrowth traits (body weight, ADG): - Measurement: Electronic scales at entry to finishing barn and at market - Frequency: Initial weight (~25 kg), final weight (~110-130 kg) - Challenge: Pigs housed in groups, so individual weighing requires sorting - Automation: Walk-through scales, automated sorting gates\nFeed efficiency (RFI): - Measurement: FIRE (Feed Intake Recording Equipment) feeders - How it works: RFID ear tag identifies pig, feeder records feed disappearance each visit - Duration: 8-12 weeks of data collection per pig - Challenge: Expensive ($50K-100K per pen), requires careful management - Benefit: Individual feed intake enables direct selection for RFI (saves $2-3 per pig in feed costs)\nBackfat and loin depth (carcass quality): - Measurement: Real-time ultrasound at ~100 kg body weight - Location: Between 10th-11th rib (standard site) - Technician training: Requires skilled ultrasound operator - Accuracy: Correlation with carcass measurements: r ≈ 0.70-0.85\nLitter size (reproduction): - Measurement: Manual counting at farrowing (birth) - Timing: Within 24-48 hours of birth - Traits recorded: Total born, born alive, stillborn, mummified - Challenge: Requires accurate sow and piglet identification, 24/7 farrowing supervision\nDairy Cattle Breeding\nMilk yield: - Traditional (DHI testing): Monthly milk weights recorded by technician - Technician visits farm once per month - Weighs milk from each cow at one milking - Adjusted to 305-day lactation yield using standardized curves - Modern (automated milking systems - AMS): Milking robot records every milking - Each cow milked 2-3× per day voluntarily - Continuous data stream: yield, milking time, flow rate - More accurate estimates, enables selection for milking speed\nMilk components (fat%, protein%): - DHI testing: Lab analysis from monthly test-day samples - AMS: Inline sensors (near-infrared spectroscopy) measure components in real-time - Accuracy: Inline sensors slightly less accurate than lab but provide daily data\nFertility: - Traits: Days open (calving to conception), daughter pregnancy rate, first-service conception - Measurement: Breeding records, pregnancy checks (palpation, ultrasound) - Challenge: Requires accurate record-keeping of inseminations and calving dates\nHealth (mastitis, lameness): - Somatic cell count (SCC): Indicator of mastitis (elevated SCC = infection) - Measured from monthly DHI test-day samples - Also measured at bulk tank level (herd average) - Lameness: Locomotion scoring (1-5 scale), mobility assessments - Subjective, requires trained observer - Computer vision systems (Chapter 25) increasingly used for automated lameness detection\nPoultry Breeding (Broilers)\nBody weight: - Measurement: Group weighing (sample of birds from pen) or individual weighing - Age: Typically at 35-42 days (market age) - Challenge: Handling stress can affect weight; standardized protocols required\nFeed efficiency (FCR): - Measurement: Group level (pen) - Total feed consumed by pen ÷ total weight gain of pen - Limitation: Can’t measure individual bird feed intake in typical commercial housing - Genomic selection: Increasingly used to predict individual FCR using DNA markers\nCarcass traits (breast yield, leg yield, abdominal fat): - Measurement: Processing plant data (post-slaughter) - Selection challenge: Must select on family information (can’t measure on the selection candidate itself) - Modern: CT scans on live birds (research settings), genomic prediction\nLeg health: - Measurement: Gait scoring (0 = normal to 5 = severe lameness) - Challenge: Subjective, requires standardized scoring protocols - Economic importance: Lame birds have reduced welfare, lower growth, higher mortality\nPoultry Breeding (Layers)\nEgg production: - Traditional: Trap nests—hen enters nest, door closes, eggs collected and identified to hen - Labor-intensive, stressful for hens - Modern: RFID nest boxes—hen’s leg band automatically identified when entering nest - Automated recording, less stressful - Eggs per hen housed, persistency of lay\nEgg quality: - Egg weight: Automated inline scales as eggs move on conveyor - Shell strength: Deformation test, breaking force - Sample of eggs per hen, measured in lab - Shell color: Visual or automated color grading - Internal quality: Haugh units (albumin height relative to egg weight) - Sample of eggs broken and measured\nFeed efficiency: - Measurement: Feed per dozen eggs or feed per kg of egg mass - Challenge: Measuring individual feed intake is difficult in cage-free systems - Genomic selection: Enables selection for feed efficiency without expensive individual measurements\nBeef Cattle Breeding\nGrowth traits (weaning weight, yearling weight): - Measurement: Scales at weaning (~205 days) and yearling (~365 days) - Adjustments: Standardized to 205-day and 365-day weights using age-adjustment factors - Contemporary groups: Animals compared within herd-year-season groups\nCarcass traits: - Live animal ultrasound: Backfat, ribeye area, intramuscular fat (marbling) - Measured at ~365 days (yearling age) or pre-slaughter - Correlation with actual carcass: r ≈ 0.60-0.80 - Actual carcass data: From progeny or siblings sent to slaughter - Marbling score, yield grade, carcass weight, ribeye area - Most accurate but requires slaughter (can’t select the animal itself)\nFeed efficiency (RFI): - Measurement: GrowSafe feeders (individual feed intake in feedlot) - Challenge: Extremely expensive, limited to seedstock herds and research - Duration: 70-120 days of feed intake data per animal - Adoption: Low (~1-2% of beef industry), primarily genomic prediction used instead\nMaternal traits: - Measurement: Weaning weight of calves (maternal ability), calving ease scores, cow size - Challenge: Traits expressed only in females, requires multiple breeding seasons - EPDs: Maternal milk EPD, maternal calving ease EPD",

    "section": "\n2.4 Recording and Managing Data",
    "text": "2.4 Recording and Managing Data\nPhenotyping produces vast amounts of data—millions of records across thousands or millions of animals. This data is the lifeblood of a breeding program. Without systematic data recording, quality control, and management, even the best phenotyping technologies are useless.\nThis section covers the practical systems that enable breeding programs to collect, validate, store, and retrieve phenotypic data reliably.\n\n2.4.1 4.1 Animal Identification Systems\nBefore we can record a phenotype, we must know which animal it belongs to. Animal identification is therefore the first essential step in data management.\nVisual Identification\nEar tags: - Plastic or metal tags attached to the ear with unique numbers - Pros: Inexpensive ($0.50-$2 per tag), easy to apply, visible from distance - Cons: Can be lost, difficult to read when dirty, prone to fading, not suitable for automated data capture\nTattoos: - Permanent ink applied inside ear or on skin - Pros: Permanent, cannot be removed or lost - Cons: Hard to read without restraint, fades over time, requires good technique\nBranding: - Hot iron or freeze branding on hide - Pros: Permanent, visible from distance - Cons: Painful, damages hide (reduces carcass value), welfare concerns, increasingly discouraged\nSpecies-specific considerations: - Cattle: Visual ear tags most common, some brands still used in range cattle - Swine: Ear notching (historical, rare now), ear tags - Sheep: Ear tags, paint marks (temporary) - Poultry: Leg bands (layers), wing bands, no ID (broilers, group selection)\nElectronic Identification (RFID)\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) uses a microchip that transmits a unique ID when scanned by a reader.\nPassive RFID: - No battery: Powered by electromagnetic field from reader - Range: Short (typically &lt;1 meter) - Applications: Ear tags (cattle, swine), leg bands (poultry), injectable transponders - Cost: $2-$5 per tag\nActive RFID: - Battery powered: Transmits continuously or on schedule - Range: Longer (up to 100+ meters) - Applications: Location tracking, estrus detection collars (dairy) - Cost: $15-50+ per tag\nHow RFID works in breeding programs:\n\n\nAnimal approaches automated system (feeder, scale, milking robot, nest box)\n\nRFID reader detects tag and reads unique ID\n\nSystem records phenotype (feed intake, body weight, milk yield, egg) linked to that animal’s ID\n\nData automatically uploaded to database\n\nExample: Swine feed efficiency (RFI) - Each pig wears an RFID ear tag with unique ID - FIRE feeder reads tag when pig enters - Feed disappearance recorded for that specific pig - 8-12 weeks of data → calculate individual RFI - No manual recording required!\nBenefits: - Automation: Eliminates manual data entry (reduces errors) - High throughput: Thousands of records per day - Real-time data: Immediate upload to database - Accuracy: No transcription errors\nChallenges: - Tag loss: 1-5% of tags lost (animals lose ears in fights, tags fall out) - Misreads: Electronic interference, dirty tags - Cost: Higher initial investment than visual ID\nDNA-Based Parentage Verification\nEven with careful record-keeping, pedigree errors occur: - Incorrect sire recorded (wrong bull/boar used) - Dam mis-identified (piglet assigned to wrong sow) - Sample swaps in lab (genotype or phenotype mislabeled)\nPedigree errors bias breeding value estimates and reduce genetic gain.\nDNA parentage testing: - Microsatellite markers (historical) or SNP panels (modern) - Compare offspring genotype to putative parents - If genotypes incompatible → pedigree error detected\nWhen used: - Routine verification: Genotype all selection candidates and verify parentage (common in swine, poultry breeding companies) - Natural mating: Assign paternity when multiple sires per pen (beef, sheep) - Quality control: Detect sample swaps or recording errors\nCost-benefit: - Cost: ~$20-$50 per animal (using SNP chips that also provide genomic data) - Benefit: Correcting even 2-5% pedigree errors significantly improves EBV accuracy and genetic gain\n\n2.4.2 4.2 Data Entry and Validation\nEven with automated systems, human data entry is often required—especially for reproductive traits, health events, and management records.\nCommon Data Entry Errors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Type\nExample\nImpact\n\n\n\nTransposed digits\nAnimal 1234 recorded as 1243\nPhenotype assigned to wrong animal\n\n\nWrong date\nBirth date entered as 2024-02-30 (impossible)\nInvalid record, breaks age calculations\n\n\nUnit errors\nWeight in pounds entered as kg (or vice versa)\nSeverely biased phenotype\n\n\nDecimal errors\n1.5 kg entered as 15 kg\nExtreme outlier\n\n\nSwapped IDs\nPhenotypes for animals A and B accidentally swapped\nBoth animals get wrong phenotypes\n\n\nMissing data\nRequired field left blank\nRecord unusable for analysis\n\n\nDuplicate records\nSame phenotype entered twice\nInflates sample size, biases estimates\n\n\nValidation Rules\nRange checks: - Birth weight must be within biologically plausible range (e.g., 0.5-2.5 kg for piglets) - Egg weight must be 40-80 g (anything outside → flag for review) - Milk yield per day &lt; 80 kg (higher values likely errors)\nDate sequence checks: - Birth date &lt; Weaning date &lt; Current date - Insemination date &lt; Calving date (and gestation ~280 days for cattle)\nID verification: - Animal ID must exist in database before phenotype can be entered - Parent IDs must exist if recording pedigree - No duplicate IDs\nLogical consistency: - Can’t have litter size of 0 (sow either farrowed or didn’t) - Can’t have male with lactation record\nImplementation: - Database constraints: Enforce rules at database level (prevent invalid entries) - Entry forms: Use dropdown menus, date pickers, range validators - Real-time feedback: Alert user immediately if entry violates rule\nTimeliness\nEnter data as soon as possible after collection: - Same day is best (memory fresh, fewer errors) - Delays lead to: Lost paper records, forgotten values, transcription errors\nDigital data capture: - Tablet or phone apps at point of measurement (enter directly into device) - Automated systems upload in real-time - Eliminates paper → digital transcription step (major source of errors)\n###4.3 Data Quality Control\nEven with validation rules, errors slip through. Quality control (QC) is the systematic process of identifying and correcting errors in existing data.\nOutlier Detection\nStatistical outliers are observations that are far from the population mean—they may be: 1. Real biological extremes (keep in dataset) 2. Measurement errors (investigate and correct or remove)\nCommon method: ±3 SD rule\n\nCalculate mean (\\(\\bar{y}\\)) and standard deviation (\\(s\\)) for a trait within contemporary group\n\nFlag values outside \\(\\bar{y} \\pm 3s\\)\n\nReview flagged records: Are they plausible? Or errors?\n\nExample (swine weaning weight): - Contemporary group: 100 piglets weaned at 21 days - Mean weight: \\(\\bar{y} = 6.2\\) kg - Standard deviation: \\(s = 0.8\\) kg - Flagging rule: Flag any piglet &lt; 3.8 kg or &gt; 8.6 kg\nSuppose one piglet shows 12.0 kg → Likely error (probably 1.2 kg entered as 12.0 kg). Investigate!\nImpossible Values\nSome errors are obvious: - Negative body weights - Birth date after measurement date - Litter size &gt; 25 piglets (biologically implausible) - Milk yield &gt; 100 kg/day (Holstein average is ~30-40 kg/day)\nAutomated checks can flag these for review.\nDuplicate Records\nSometimes the same phenotype is entered twice (e.g., technician forgot they already entered it): - Check for identical animal ID + trait + date + value - Remove duplicates (keep only one copy)\nMissing Data Patterns\nRandom missing data: A few animals missing records due to chance → usually not a problem\nSystematic missing data: Can bias genetic evaluations - Example: Only sick animals get health records → makes disease look more common than it is - Example: Smallest piglets not weighed (too small to handle) → inflates average weaning weight\nSolution: Ensure complete data collection for all animals in contemporary groups whenever possible.\n\n2.4.3 4.4 Database Structures (Brief Introduction)\nModern breeding programs store data in relational databases—systems that organize data into tables linked by keys.\nCore Tables\n1.

For now, the key takeaway: Structured data storage is essential for managing breeding program data at scale.",

    "section": "\n2.5 Breeding Objectives",
    "text": "2.5 Breeding Objectives\nWe’ve covered what traits exist (Section 2) and how to measure them (Sections 3-4). Now we address a critical strategic question: What should we actually select for?\nThis question defines the breeding objective (also called the breeding goal)—the traits we want to improve and their relative importance. Defining a clear breeding objective is essential because:\n\n\nResources are limited: We can’t measure everything on every animal\n\nTrade-offs exist: Some traits are genetically antagonistic (improving one worsens another)\n\nPriorities differ: Different production systems have different economic drivers\n\n\n2.5.1 5.1 Defining the Breeding Goal\nThe breeding goal should reflect the economic reality of the production system. Ask:\n\n\nWhat traits drive revenue? (milk sold, pigs weaned, eggs produced, carcass weight)\n\nWhat traits drive costs? (feed consumption, veterinary treatments, mortality, days to market)\n\nWhat are the constraints? (regulations, animal welfare standards, market demands, sustainability goals)\n\nFormal definition:\nThe breeding goal (H) is a linear combination of traits weighted by their economic importance:\n\\[H = v_1 \\cdot \\text{BV}_1 + v_2 \\cdot \\text{BV}_2 + \\cdots + v_n \\cdot \\text{BV}_n\\]\nWhere: - \\(H\\) = Aggregate breeding value (overall genetic merit) - \\(v_i\\) = Economic weight for trait \\(i\\) ($/unit improvement) - \\(\\text{BV}_i\\) = Breeding value for trait \\(i\\)\nWe’ll formalize this in Chapter 9 (Selection Index). For now, understand that economic weights determine how much we value improvement in each trait.\nExample (simplified dairy breeding goal):\n\\[H = 0.30 \\cdot \\text{Milk} + 2.50 \\cdot \\text{Fat kg} + 4.00 \\cdot \\text{Protein kg} - 3.00 \\cdot \\text{Days Open} + 8.00 \\cdot \\text{Productive Life}\\]\nThis says: - Each extra kg of milk is worth $0.30 - Each extra kg of fat is worth $2.50 - Each extra kg of protein is worth $4.00 - Each day reduction in days open is worth $3.00 - Each extra month of productive life is worth $8.00\n\n2.5.2 5.2 Single Trait vs. Multiple Trait Selection\nSingle Trait Selection\nSingle trait selection focuses on improving one trait, ignoring all others.\nWhen it’s appropriate: - Research context: Studying response to selection for a specific trait - Extreme scenarios: One trait dominates economic value (rare in commercial breeding)\nExample: Selecting only for egg production in layers - Benefit: Fast progress in egg numbers - Problem: Correlated traits may deteriorate: - Egg weight may decrease (negative genetic correlation) - Shell quality may decline - Feed efficiency may worsen - Mortality may increase (metabolic stress)\nResult: Short-term gain in eggs, long-term problems with profitability and welfare.\nMultiple Trait Selection\nMultiple trait selection simultaneously improves several traits, accounting for economic importance and genetic correlations.\nWhy it’s necessary: - Profitability depends on multiple traits, not just one - Genetic correlations mean selecting for one trait affects others - Balance is essential: Can’t maximize production at the expense of reproduction, health, or welfare\nApproach: - Selection index: Combine traits into single value (H) that predicts economic merit - Optimal weights: Account for economic values, heritabilities, and genetic correlations - Selection decision: Rank animals by index value, select the top percentage\nWe’ll develop selection index theory in Chapter 9.\n\n2.5.3 5.3 Economic Weights (Introduction)\nEconomic weights quantify the value of a one-unit genetic improvement in a trait, holding all other traits constant.\nFormal definition:\n\\[v_i = \\frac{\\partial \\text{Profit}}{\\partial \\text{BV}_i}\\]\nThis is the partial derivative of profit with respect to the breeding value for trait \\(i\\).\nIn plain language: If we could magically increase an animal’s breeding value for trait \\(i\\) by 1 unit (1 kg, 1 day, 1 egg, etc.), how much would lifetime profit change?\nExample (swine): - Economic weight for ADG: +$15 per 100 g/day improvement - Faster growth → fewer days to market → lower facility/labor costs → more turns per year - Economic weight for feed efficiency (RFI): -$30 per 0.1 kg/day improvement in RFI - Lower RFI (more efficient) → less feed consumed → major cost savings (feed = 60-70% of costs) - Economic weight for backfat: -$8 per 1 mm reduction - Leaner carcasses receive premium pricing\nDeriving economic weights: Economic weights are derived from profit equations that model the production system:\n\\[\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Costs}\\]\nFor swine: \\[\\text{Profit} = (\\text{Carcass Weight} \\times \\text{Price per kg}) - (\\text{Feed Cost} + \\text{Fixed Costs})\\]\nBy taking partial derivatives with respect to each trait’s breeding value, we get economic weights.\nWe’ll work through detailed examples in Chapter 9. For now, recognize that economic weights: - Differ by production system (dairy, beef, terminal swine vs. maternal swine) - Change over time (as market prices, costs, and regulations change) - Require careful analysis (not just guesswork!)\n\n2.5.4 5.4 Examples of Breeding Objectives by Species\nLet’s explore real-world breeding objectives for major livestock species. Notice how objectives differ by production role (maternal vs. terminal, milk vs. beef, etc.).\nDairy Cattle: Net Merit Index (NM$)\nPurpose: Maximize lifetime profit of a cow’s daughters\nTraits included (simplified; actual index has 20+ traits):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEconomic Weight\nWhy It Matters\n\n\n\nMilk yield (kg)\n+$0.02-0.04 per kg\nRevenue from milk sales\n\n\nFat yield (kg)\n+$2.00-3.00 per kg\nComponent pricing (fat valued highly)\n\n\nProtein yield (kg)\n+$3.50-5.00 per kg\nComponent pricing (protein most valuable)\n\n\nProductive life (months)\n+$8-12 per month\nReduce replacement costs, more lactations\n\n\nDaughter pregnancy rate (%)\n+$15-25 per %\nReduce days open, more calves, lower breeding costs\n\n\nSomatic cell score\n-$50-80 per unit increase\nMastitis indicator; higher SCC = milk loss, treatments\n\n\nBody size composite\n-$1-3 per unit\nLarger cows eat more feed (maintenance cost)\n\n\n\nKey insights: - Components valued more than volume: Protein yield has ~100× higher weight than milk yield per unit - Fertility matters: Despite low heritability, fertility has high economic weight - Health is economically important: Mastitis resistance (low SCC) is highly valued - Size has negative weight: Bigger ≠ better (higher maintenance costs)\nHistorical shift: - Pre-2000: Selection focused almost exclusively on milk yield - Result: Milk production increased dramatically, but fertility, health, and longevity declined - Post-2000: Balanced selection via Net Merit → stabilized fertility and health while continuing milk yield progress\nSwine: Maternal vs. Terminal Lines\nSwine breeding programs maintain separate lines with different breeding objectives:\nMaternal Line Objective (Large White, Landrace):\nGoal: Maximize sow productivity and longevity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nNumber born alive (NBA)\nHigh\nMore piglets = more revenue\n\n\nPiglet survival to weaning\nHigh\nNo value if piglets die\n\n\nMaternal ability (milk production)\nHigh\nHeavier weaning weights\n\n\nLongevity\nHigh\nSows cost $200-300 to develop; need 4-6 parities to pay off\n\n\nFeed efficiency\nModerate\nImportant but less than reproduction\n\n\nGrowth rate\nLow\nMaternal gilts not slaughtered (growth less critical)\n\n\nCarcass leanness\nLow\nNot slaughtered for meat\n\n\n\nTerminal Sire Line Objective (Duroc, Pietrain):\nGoal: Maximize efficiency and carcass value of market offspring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nGrowth rate (ADG)\nHigh\nFaster to market = lower costs, more throughput\n\n\nFeed efficiency (RFI)\nVery High\nFeed costs dominate; RFI improvement = major savings\n\n\nCarcass leanness (low backfat)\nHigh\nLean carcasses receive premium\n\n\nLoin depth / muscle\nHigh\nMore saleable meat per carcass\n\n\nMeat quality (pH, color)\nModerate\nAffects consumer acceptance\n\n\nLitter size\nNone\nTerminal sires mated to F₁ females (sire’s litter size doesn’t matter for commercial production)\n\n\n\nWhy separate lines? - Trade-offs: Selection for extreme growth and leanness can reduce reproductive fitness - Crossbreeding: Maternal line gilts crossed with terminal sires → commercial pigs get both maternal advantages (from dam) and growth/carcass advantages (from sire)\nBroiler Chickens\nGoal: Fast, efficient growth to market weight with good carcass yield and acceptable leg health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nEconomic Weight Context\n\n\n\nBody weight at 42 days\nVery High\nMore meat sold per bird\n\n\nFeed conversion ratio (FCR)\nVery High\nFeed = 60-70% of costs\n\n\nBreast meat yield (%)\nHigh\nBreast is most valuable cut\n\n\nLeg health / soundness\nModerate\nWelfare concern; lame birds grow slower\n\n\nLivability (survival)\nHigh\nDead birds = total loss\n\n\nUniformity\nModerate\nEasier processing if birds similar size\n\n\n\nChallenge: Genetic correlation between growth and leg problems - Fast growth → heavier body weight → more stress on immature leg bones → higher lameness - Solution: Multi-trait selection index that balances growth with leg health\nIndustry progress: - 1950s: Broilers required 16-18 weeks to reach 2 kg, FCR ≈ 4.0 - 2020s: Broilers reach 2.6-2.8 kg in 6 weeks, FCR ≈ 1.6-1.8 - Genetic gain: ~60-80 g per year increase in body weight, ~0.02-0.03 improvement in FCR per year\nLaying Hens\nGoal: Maximize egg production with good egg quality and feed efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nEggs per hen housed\nVery High\nPrimary revenue source\n\n\nEgg weight\nHigh\nPremium for larger eggs (but not too large for cartons)\n\n\nShell strength\nHigh\n6-10% breakage rate; stronger shells = fewer cracks\n\n\nFeed efficiency\nHigh\nFeed cost per dozen eggs critical for profit\n\n\nPersistency of lay\nModerate\nMaintain production after peak\n\n\nLivability\nHigh\nMortality reduces eggs per hen housed\n\n\nFeather cover / pecking\nModerate\nWelfare and production issue\n\n\n\nTrade-off: Egg production vs. egg weight - Genetic correlation: r_A ≈ -0.2 to -0.4 (antagonistic) - Selecting for more eggs tends to reduce average egg weight - Solution: Include both in index with appropriate weights\nBeef Cattle: Terminal vs. Maternal\nLike swine, beef cattle breeding distinguishes terminal and maternal objectives.\nTerminal Sire Index (for bulls mated to produce slaughter calves):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait (EPD)\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nYearling weight\nHigh\nHeavier calves at sale\n\n\nCarcass weight\nHigh\nMore meat = more revenue\n\n\nMarbling score\nHigh\nPremium for Choice/Prime grades\n\n\nRibeye area\nHigh\nMore high-value cuts\n\n\nCalving ease (direct)\nModerate\nAvoid dystocia when bull used on heifers\n\n\nBirth weight\nNegative\nLower birth weight = easier calving\n\n\n\nMaternal Index (for replacement heifers and cows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrait (EPD)\nEmphasis\nWhy\n\n\n\nHeifer pregnancy rate\nHigh\nMust breed to be productive\n\n\nCalving ease (maternal)\nHigh\nCow must calve unassisted\n\n\nMilk (maternal milk EPD)\nModerate\nBetter milk = heavier weaning weights in calves\n\n\nStayability\nHigh\nCows that last 6+ years amortize development costs\n\n\nMature cow size\nNegative\nSmaller cows = lower feed costs (maintenance)\n\n\nDocility\nModerate\nCalm cows safer to handle",

    "section": "\n2.6 True Breeding Value (TBV)",
    "text": "2.6 True Breeding Value (TBV)\nWe’ve now covered traits, phenotyping, data management, and breeding objectives. But there’s one critical concept we haven’t yet defined: What exactly is it that we’re trying to select for?\nThe answer is the True Breeding Value (TBV)—the genetic merit of an animal as a parent. Understanding TBV is fundamental to everything that follows in this course.\n\n2.6.1 6.1 Definition of True Breeding Value\nTrue Breeding Value (TBV) is defined as:\n\nThe sum of the average effects of all alleles an individual carries, summed across all loci that affect a trait.\n\nMore precisely:\n\\[\\text{TBV} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha_i\\]\nWhere: - \\(n\\) = number of loci affecting the trait - \\(\\alpha_i\\) = average effect of the allele at locus \\(i\\) that the individual carries\nIn simpler terms: TBV represents twice the expected deviation of an animal’s offspring from the population mean, assuming the animal is mated to average individuals.\nWhy “twice”? Because an offspring receives half its genes from each parent. So if a parent’s TBV is +10 kg, its offspring will be +5 kg above average (on average), assuming the other parent is average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTBV vs. Phenotype: A Critical Distinction\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype (P): What we observe and measure on the animal itself\n\nTBV: The genetic value the animal passes to its offspring\n\nThese are not the same! An animal with a high phenotype may have: - High TBV (genetically superior) - Favorable environment (good pen, extra feed, optimal health) - Both\nOnly TBV is heritable—passed to offspring.\n\n\nExample: Two dairy cows, both producing 12,000 kg milk per lactation\n\n\nCow A: TBV = +500 kg, Environment = +500 kg → Phenotype = 12,000 kg\n\nCow B: TBV = +1,000 kg, Environment = 0 kg → Phenotype = 12,000 kg\n\nBoth cows produce the same milk, but Cow B is the superior breeding animal. Her daughters will average +500 kg more milk than Cow A’s daughters (each inherits half the dam’s TBV, plus half from the sire).\n\n2.6.2 6.2 Why TBV is Important\nTBV is the target of selection because:\n\n\nTBV is heritable: An animal passes (on average) half its TBV to each offspring\n\nTBV predicts offspring performance: Animals with high TBV produce superior offspring\n\nTBV breeds true: Unlike environmental effects, TBV is permanent and transmitted across generations\n\nTBV determines genetic progress: Selecting high-TBV parents creates cumulative genetic gain\n\nContrast with environmental effects:\n\n\nFavorable environment (best pen, extra nutrition, optimal health) improves an animal’s phenotype but doesn’t pass to offspring\n\n\nHigh TBV improves the animal’s phenotype and passes half to each offspring, creating permanent improvement\n\nThis is why we spend so much effort estimating TBV (Chapter 7) and designing selection programs to maximize genetic gain (Chapter 6).\n\n2.6.3 6.3 TBV is Unknown but Estimable\nHere’s the challenge: We can never observe TBV directly.\nTBV is a theoretical construct—the sum of effects of alleles we can’t see (unless we sequence the genome and know the effect of every variant, which we don’t). We only observe phenotypes, which are a mixture of genetics and environment:\n\\[P = \\text{TBV} + E\\]\n(We’ll formalize this more carefully in Chapter 3, partitioning genetics into additive, dominance, and epistatic components.)\nSo how do we estimate TBV?\nWe use information that is correlated with TBV:\n\n\nAnimal’s own phenotype: Imperfect (includes environmental effects), but informative\n\nCorrelation with TBV depends on heritability: \\(r = \\sqrt{h^2}\\)\n\n\n\n\nPedigree information: Parents, grandparents, siblings\n\nParents pass half their TBV to offspring\nFull sibs share 50% of genes, half-sibs share 25%\n\n\n\nProgeny performance: Offspring inherit half their parent’s TBV\n\nHighly informative, especially if many progeny measured\n\n\n\nGenomic information: DNA markers (SNPs) linked to causal genes\n\nCaptures Mendelian sampling variation (Chapter 13)\nEnables prediction at birth, before phenotypes available\n\n\n\nBy combining all this information using statistical models (BLUP, genomic BLUP), we produce Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs):\n\\[\\text{EBV} \\approx \\text{TBV}\\]\nEBVs are our best guess at an animal’s true genetic merit. The accuracy of the EBV depends on how much information we have:\n\n\nLow accuracy (r ≈ 0.30-0.50): Young animal, no progeny, no genomic data\n\nModerate accuracy (r ≈ 0.50-0.70): Own phenotype, pedigree, or genomic data\n\nHigh accuracy (r ≈ 0.80-0.95): Many progeny tested, or genomic data + extensive phenotyping\n\nWe’ll cover EBV estimation in detail in Chapter 7.\n\n2.6.4 6.4 Ranking Animals by TBV\nThe goal of selection is simple:\n\nRank animals by their TBV and select the top-ranked individuals as parents.\n\nIn practice, since we don’t know TBV, we:\n\n\nEstimate TBV using available information → produces EBVs\n\nRank animals by EBV (or by a selection index combining multiple EBVs)\n\nSelect the top percentage (e.g., top 10%, top 1%) as parents\n\nMate selected parents to produce the next generation\n\nRepeat the process, accumulating genetic gain over generations\n\nExample: Selecting replacement gilts in swine\nA breeding company evaluates 1,000 candidate gilts. For each gilt, they have: - Phenotypes: Growth rate, backfat, litter size of dam - Pedigree: Known parents, grandparents - Genomic data: Genotyped with 60K SNP chip\nThey run a genetic evaluation (BLUP + genomic prediction) to estimate EBVs for each trait, then compute a selection index combining traits with economic weights.\nResult: Each gilt gets a single index value (estimate of aggregate TBV, \\(H\\)).\nSelection: Top 100 gilts (10%) selected as replacement breeding stock.\nOutcome: The selected gilts have higher average TBV than the unselected gilts → next generation has higher genetic merit → genetic progress.\n\n2.6.5 6.5 Conceptual Diagram: Phenotype, TBV, and Environment\nLet’s visualize the relationship between phenotype, TBV, and environment for a hypothetical trait (e.g., body weight at 150 days in swine).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Relationship between phenotype (P), true breeding value (TBV), and environment (E). Each animal’s phenotype is the sum of its TBV and environmental deviation. Selection aims to identify animals with high TBV.\n\n\n\n\nKey insights from the diagram:\n\n\nPhenotype is the sum of TBV and environment: Animals with identical phenotypes can have very different TBVs\n\nSelection on phenotype alone is imperfect: Some animals with high phenotypes have only moderate TBV (they benefited from favorable environments)\n\nGoal of genetic evaluation: Use all available information (own performance, relatives, genomic data) to separate TBV from environmental effects and rank animals accurately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThe Central Challenge of Animal Breeding\n\n\n\nWe want to select animals with high TBV, but we can only observe phenotypes (which include environmental effects).\nThe entire machinery of quantitative genetics—heritability, genetic correlations, BLUP, genomic selection—exists to solve this problem: How do we accurately estimate TBV from noisy phenotypic data?",

    "text": "2.8 Summary\nThis chapter laid the foundation for understanding what we select for in animal breeding and how we measure it. Let’s review the key concepts:\n\n2.8.1 Key Points\n1. Traits of Economic Importance\n\nLivestock traits fall into six categories: production, reproduction, health/fitness, efficiency, quality, and welfare\n\n\nHigh heritability traits (h² &gt; 0.40) respond quickly to selection: growth rate, carcass traits, egg weight\n\nLow heritability traits (h² &lt; 0.20) respond slowly: fertility, disease resistance, longevity\nEconomic importance ≠ heritability — some low-heritability traits (e.g., fertility) have huge economic impact\n\n2. Phenotypes and Phenotyping\n\n\nPhenotype = Genotype + Environment (P = G + E)\nHigh-quality phenotyping requires both accuracy (correct on average) and precision (repeatable)\n\nChallenges: Cost (electronic feeders $50K-100K+), time (longevity takes years), invasiveness (carcass traits require slaughter), throughput\n\nModern technologies enable automated, high-throughput phenotyping: RFID feeders, milking robots, ultrasound, computer vision\n\n3. Recording and Managing Data\n\n\nAnimal identification is essential: Visual ID (ear tags), electronic ID (RFID), DNA parentage verification\n\nData quality control prevents errors: Range checks, outlier detection, duplicate removal\n\nValidation rules catch errors at entry: Impossible dates, out-of-range values, missing required fields\n\nRelational databases organize data: Animals, Phenotypes, Genotypes tables linked by IDs\n\n4. Breeding Objectives\n\n\nBreeding objective (H) defines what traits to improve and their relative economic importance\n\nEconomic weights (v) quantify the value of one-unit genetic improvement in each trait\n\nSingle-trait selection is fast but ignores correlated traits and can cause problems\n\nMulti-trait selection (selection index) balances multiple traits, accounting for economic values and genetic correlations\n\nObjectives differ by species and production role: Maternal vs. terminal (swine, beef), milk vs. beef (cattle)\n\n5. True Breeding Value (TBV)\n\n\nTBV is the sum of average effects of an animal’s alleles—its genetic merit as a parent\n\n\nTBV is heritable: Animals pass (on average) half their TBV to each offspring\n\nTBV is unknown: We can never observe TBV directly, only phenotypes (P = TBV + E)\n\nEBVs are estimates of TBV: Combining own phenotype, relatives, pedigree, and genomic data using BLUP\n\nGoal of selection: Rank animals by TBV (or EBV) and select the top individuals as parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThe Foundation of Genetic Improvement\n\n\n\nHigh-quality phenotypes + accurate data management + clear breeding objectives = successful genetic improvement.\nWithout accurate phenotypes, genetic evaluations will be biased. Without good data management, phenotypes will be unreliable or unusable. Without clear breeding objectives, we won’t know what traits to improve or how to weight them.\nThis chapter’s concepts underpin everything that follows in this course.",

    "text": "2.9 Practice Problems\n\n2.9.1 Conceptual Questions\n1. Trait Classification\nClassify each of the following traits into one of the six categories (production, reproduction, health/fitness, efficiency, quality, welfare). Then indicate whether you expect the trait to have high (h² &gt; 0.40), moderate (h² = 0.20-0.40), or low (h² &lt; 0.20) heritability.\n\nMarbling score in beef cattle\nLitter size in swine\nFeed conversion ratio in broilers\nSomatic cell count (mastitis indicator) in dairy\nEgg shell strength in layers\nTemperament (docility) in beef cattle\n\n2. Phenotype vs. TBV\nTwo Holstein cows, Bessie and Daisy, both produce 11,500 kg of milk in their first lactation.\n\nBessie has an EBV of +400 kg for milk yield\nDaisy has an EBV of +800 kg for milk yield\n\n\nWhy might both cows have the same phenotype (11,500 kg) despite different EBVs?\nWhich cow would you prefer as a breeding animal? Why?\nIf both cows are bred to the same bull (EBV = +600 kg), what is the expected milk yield of their daughters (assuming population average = 10,000 kg)?\n\n3. Measurement Accuracy vs. Precision\nExplain the difference between accuracy and precision in phenotypic measurements. Provide an example of a measurement that could be:\n\nAccurate but imprecise\nPrecise but inaccurate\nBoth accurate and precise\n\nWhy does each property matter for genetic evaluation?\n4. Data Quality Control\nYou are reviewing weaning weight data for 100 piglets born in the same week. The mean weaning weight (21 days) is 6.2 kg with a standard deviation of 0.9 kg. Using the ±3 SD rule, you identify the following potential outliers:\n\nPiglet A: 12.5 kg\nPiglet B: 3.0 kg\nPiglet C: 9.1 kg\n\n\nFor each piglet, calculate whether it falls outside the ±3 SD range.\nFor each outlier, suggest two possible explanations (one biological, one data entry error).\nHow would you investigate to determine if the value is correct or an error?\n\n5. Breeding Objectives\nExplain why a swine breeding company maintains separate breeding objectives for maternal lines (Large White, Landrace) vs. terminal sire lines (Duroc, Pietrain). What traits are emphasized in each, and why?\n6. Contemporary Groups\nWhy is it important to account for contemporary group effects (e.g., pen, herd-year-season) when estimating breeding values? Provide an example showing how ignoring contemporary groups could lead to incorrect selection decisions.\n\n2.9.2 Quantitative Problems\n7. Heritability and Response\nBackfat depth in swine has a heritability of h² = 0.50, a phenotypic mean of 13 mm, and a phenotypic standard deviation of 2.5 mm.\n\nIf you select pigs with an average backfat of 10 mm as parents (3 mm below the mean), what is the expected selection differential (S)?\nWhat is the additive genetic standard deviation (σ_A)?\nUsing the simplified formula R = h² × S, what is the expected response to selection in the offspring generation?\n\n8. Economic Weights\nA swine breeding program estimates the following economic weights for a terminal sire index:\n\nAverage daily gain (ADG): +$15 per 100 g/day improvement\nResidual feed intake (RFI): -$30 per 0.1 kg/day improvement (negative RFI is better)\nBackfat depth: -$8 per 1 mm reduction\n\nTwo candidate boars have the following EBVs:\n\n\nBoar\nADG (g/day)\nRFI (kg/day)\nBackfat (mm)\n\n\n\nBoar A\n+50\n-0.15\n-1.0\n\n\nBoar B\n+30\n-0.25\n-1.5\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the index value (H) for each boar.\nWhich boar has superior genetic merit according to the index?\nExplain how genetic correlations between traits could influence which traits receive higher emphasis in the index (concept only, no calculations needed).\n\n9. Outlier Detection in R\nUsing the swine_data dataset from Demo 1 in this chapter, write R code to:\n\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of weaning_weight\n\nIdentify all animals with weaning_weight values outside the ±3 SD range\nCreate a histogram of weaning_weight with vertical lines showing the ±3 SD cutoffs\n\n(Hint: Adapt the code from Demo 3.)\n10. True Breeding Value Simulation\nIn the TBV conceptual diagram (Figure 6.5), we simulated a population where:\n\nTBV ~ N(100, 10²)\nEnvironment ~ N(0, 15²)\nPhenotype = TBV + Environment\n\n\nWhat is the heritability (h²) of this simulated trait?

Terms are listed alphabetically.\nAccuracy (r): Correlation between estimated breeding value (EBV) and true breeding value (TBV). Range: 0 to 1. Higher accuracy means more reliable prediction.\nAdditive genetic effect: The sum of the average effects of alleles at all loci affecting a trait. Determines breeding value and is transmitted to offspring.\nAdditive genetic variance (σ²_A): Variance in breeding values within a population. Determines heritability and response to selection.\nAI (Artificial Insemination): Technique for breeding animals by collecting and depositing semen artificially rather than through natural mating.\nAllele: One of two or more alternative forms of a gene at a specific locus.\nAllele frequency: Proportion of a specific allele in a population. Example: If 70% of alleles at a locus are “A”, the allele frequency of A is 0.70.",
