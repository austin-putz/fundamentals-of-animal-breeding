# Glossary of Genetic Terms {#sec-glossary .unnumbered}

This glossary provides concise definitions of key terms used throughout the book. Terms are listed alphabetically.

---

## A

**Accuracy (r)**: Correlation between estimated breeding value (EBV) and true breeding value (TBV). Range: 0 to 1. Higher accuracy means more reliable prediction.

**Additive genetic effect**: The sum of the average effects of alleles at all loci affecting a trait. Determines breeding value and is transmitted to offspring.

**Additive genetic variance (σ²_A)**: Variance in breeding values within a population. Determines heritability and response to selection.

**AI (Artificial Insemination)**: Technique for breeding animals by collecting and depositing semen artificially rather than through natural mating.

**Allele**: One of two or more alternative forms of a gene at a specific locus.

**Allele frequency**: Proportion of a specific allele in a population. Example: If 70% of alleles at a locus are "A", the allele frequency of A is 0.70.

---

## B

**BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction)**: Statistical method for estimating breeding values that uses all available information (own records, relatives, genomic data) optimally.

**Breeding goal (H)**: The aggregate genetic merit we want to improve, typically a weighted combination of multiple traits based on their economic importance.

**Breeding value (BV)**: The sum of the average effects of an animal's alleles. Represents the genetic merit of an animal as a parent. Often estimated as EBV.

---

## C

**Contemporary group**: A group of animals raised in the same environment and time period (e.g., same herd-year-season). Used to account for environmental effects in genetic evaluation.

**Correlated response**: Change in one trait (Y) as a result of selection on another trait (X), due to genetic correlation between the traits.

**Crossbreeding**: Mating animals from different breeds or lines to exploit heterosis and breed complementarity.

---

## D

## E

**EBV (Estimated Breeding Value)**: Statistical prediction of an animal's true breeding value (TBV) based on available information (phenotypes, pedigree, genomics).

**Environmental effect (E)**: All non-genetic factors affecting phenotype, including management, nutrition, health, measurement error, etc.

## G

**GBLUP (Genomic BLUP)**: Extension of BLUP that uses genomic relationship matrix (G) instead of pedigree-based relationship matrix (A).

**GEBV (Genomic Estimated Breeding Value)**: Breeding value estimated using genomic information (SNP genotypes) in addition to pedigree and phenotypes.

**Generation interval (L)**: Average age of parents when their offspring are born. Shorter L allows faster genetic progress.

**Genetic correlation (r_A)**: Correlation between additive genetic effects for two traits. Ranges from -1 to +1. Caused by pleiotropy or linkage.

**Genetic variance (σ²_G)**: Total variance due to genetic effects. Can be partitioned into additive, dominance, and epistatic components.

**Genome**: The complete set of DNA in an organism, including all genes.

**Genomic relationship matrix (G)**: Matrix of relationships among animals calculated from SNP genotypes. Captures realized (actual) relationships.

**Genomic selection**: Using genome-wide DNA markers (SNPs) to predict breeding values, enabling selection of young animals without waiting for phenotypes or progeny.

**Genotype**: The genetic makeup of an individual at one or more loci.

**Genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E)**: Different genotypes respond differently to environmental changes. Can complicate breeding across diverse environments.

**GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study)**: Statistical analysis to identify SNPs or genomic regions associated with traits.

---

## H

**Heritability (h²)**: Proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic effects. h² = σ²_A / σ²_P. Range: 0 to 1.

**Heterosis (hybrid vigor)**: Superior performance of crossbred offspring compared to the average of the purebred parents. Most pronounced for fitness traits.

**Heterozygote**: An individual with two different alleles at a locus (e.g., Aa).

**Homozygote**: An individual with two identical alleles at a locus (e.g., AA or aa).

---

## I

**Imputation**: Predicting missing or ungenotyped SNPs using information from a reference panel of animals genotyped at higher density.

**Inbreeding**: Mating of related individuals. Increases homozygosity and can lead to inbreeding depression.

**Inbreeding coefficient (F)**: Probability that two alleles at a locus are identical by descent. Range: 0 to 1.

**Inbreeding depression**: Reduction in performance (especially for fitness traits) in inbred animals due to increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

**Index (Selection Index)**: Linear combination of information sources (phenotypes or EBVs) used to rank animals for selection. Maximizes correlation with the breeding goal.

---

## L

**Linkage**: Physical proximity of genes on the same chromosome. Linked genes are inherited together more often than expected by chance.

**Linkage disequilibrium (LD)**: Non-random association between alleles at different loci. Basis for genomic selection (SNPs in LD with causal mutations).

**Locus (plural: loci)**: A specific position on a chromosome where a gene or DNA marker is located.

---

## M

**MAF (Minor Allele Frequency)**: Frequency of the less common allele at a locus in a population.

**Marker**: A DNA sequence (e.g., SNP) with a known physical location on a chromosome, used to track inheritance.

**Mendelian sampling**: Random sampling of parental alleles passed to offspring. Causes offspring to deviate from midparent average.

**Mixed model**: Statistical model with both fixed effects (e.g., contemporary groups) and random effects (e.g., breeding values).

---

## N

**Nucleus herd/flock**: Elite population at the top of a breeding pyramid where selection is most intense and genetic improvement originates.

---

## O

**OCS (Optimum Contribution Selection)**: Method that simultaneously optimizes selection and mating decisions to maximize genetic gain while constraining inbreeding.

## P

**Pedigree**: Record of an animal's ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.).

**Permanent environmental effect (PE)**: Non-genetic environmental effect that persists across all records on an animal (e.g., udder damage in dairy cows).

**Phenotype**: Observable characteristic of an individual (e.g., body weight, milk yield). Determined by genotype and environment.

**Phenotypic variance (σ²_P)**: Total variance in a trait observed in a population.

**Pleiotropy**: A single gene affects multiple traits. Major cause of genetic correlations.

**Polygenic trait**: Trait controlled by many genes, each with small effect. Most economically important traits are polygenic.

## Q

**QTL (Quantitative Trait Locus)**: A region of DNA associated with variation in a quantitative trait. May contain one or more genes affecting the trait.

**QTN (Quantitative Trait Nucleotide)**: A specific causal mutation (nucleotide change) affecting a quantitative trait.

**Quantitative trait**: Trait with continuous distribution in a population, controlled by many genes and influenced by environment (e.g., growth rate, milk yield).

---

## R

**Reliability (r²)**: Squared correlation between EBV and TBV. Measure of confidence in EBV. Same as accuracy squared.

**Repeatability (r)**: Correlation between repeated records on the same animal. r = (σ²_A + σ²_PE) / σ²_P. Upper limit of heritability.

**Response to selection (R)**: Genetic change per generation (or per year) resulting from selection. Predicted by breeder's equation.

## S

**Selection differential (S)**: Difference between the mean of selected parents and the population mean. Expressed in phenotypic units.

**Selection index**: See **Index**.

**Selection intensity (i)**: Standardized selection differential (S / σ_P). Function of the proportion of animals selected.

**Simply inherited trait**: Trait controlled by one or few genes with major effects (e.g., coat color). Follows Mendelian ratios.

**SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)**: A single base pair difference in DNA sequence between individuals. Most common type of genetic marker.

## T

**TBV (True Breeding Value)**: The actual (unknown) breeding value of an animal. Goal of genetic evaluation is to estimate TBV.

**Terminal cross**: Crossbreeding system where all offspring are marketed (none retained for breeding). Maximizes heterosis in market animals.
