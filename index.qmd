## Why Animal Breeding Matters

Animal breeding has transformed livestock productivity over the past century:

- **Dairy cattle** produce 4-5× more milk than their ancestors from the 1950s
- **Broiler chickens** reach market weight in half the time with dramatically improved feed efficiency
- **Swine** produce larger litters with leaner, faster-growing offspring
- **Beef cattle** exhibit improved carcass quality, feed efficiency, and maternal ability

These improvements directly impact:

- 🌍 **Food security**: Efficient animal protein production for a growing population
- ♻️ **Sustainability**: Reduced environmental footprint per unit of product
- 💰 **Economic viability**: Improved profitability for livestock producers
- 🐄 **Animal welfare**: Selection for health, longevity, and reduced stress

Understanding animal breeding is essential for careers in production agriculture, genetics companies, breed associations, and agricultural research.

## What You'll Learn: Chapter-by-Chapter Overview

### Part 1: Foundations of Animal Breeding

#### **Chapter 1: Introduction to Animal Breeding**

Learn how the animal breeding industry works:

- What is animal breeding and why does it matter?
- How genetics companies generate revenue (semen sales, females, embryos, genomic testing)
- Industry structure by species (swine, poultry, dairy, beef, horses)
- Major players: Genus/PIC, Cobb-Vantress, Select Sires, breed associations
- Pyramid breeding structures (nucleus-multiplier-commercial)

**Key takeaway**: Understand the business context that drives breeding decisions.

---

#### **Chapter 2: Selection Basics**

Master the fundamentals of genetic selection:

- Traits of economic importance (production, reproduction, health, efficiency, quality)
- Phenotyping: how we measure traits accurately
- Data recording and quality control
- Defining breeding objectives
- Introduction to True Breeding Value (TBV)

**Key takeaway**: High-quality data is the foundation of genetic improvement.

---

#### **Chapter 3: Basic Genetic Model**

Learn to partition phenotype into genetic and environmental components:

- The basic model: y = μ + A + E
- Additive vs. dominance vs. epistatic effects
- Why additive effects drive selection response
- Variance partitioning (σ²_P = σ²_A + σ²_D + σ²_E)
- Parent-offspring relationships

**Key takeaway**: Only additive genetic effects are reliably transmitted to offspring.

---

#### **Chapter 4: Quantitative vs. Simply Inherited Traits**

Understand different types of genetic architecture:

- Simply inherited traits (single genes, major effects): coat color, polled/horned, genetic defects
- Quantitative traits (many genes, small effects): growth, reproduction, production
- Why most economic traits are quantitative
- Threshold traits and mixed models
- Modern genomics bridges the gap

**Key takeaway**: Breeding strategies differ for simply inherited vs. quantitative traits.

---

### Part 2: Genetic Parameters

#### **Chapter 5: Heritability and Repeatability**

Learn the most important parameter in animal breeding:

- Heritability (h²): proportion of variance due to additive genetics
- Interpreting heritability (high: >0.40; moderate: 0.20-0.40; low: <0.20)
- Common misconceptions about heritability
- Repeatability (r): upper limit of heritability
- Permanent environmental effects (PE)

**Examples**: Growth traits (h² = 0.35), reproductive traits (h² = 0.10), carcass traits (h² = 0.45)

**Key takeaway**: Higher heritability means faster response to selection.

---

#### **Chapter 6: Breeder's Equation and Selection Response**

Predict genetic progress with the breeder's equation:

- The equation: R = (i × r × σ_A) / L
- Selection intensity (i): how hard we select
- Accuracy (r): how well we predict breeding values
- Genetic standard deviation (σ_A): amount of genetic variation
- Generation interval (L): age of parents when offspring are born
- Trade-offs among the four factors (especially accuracy vs. generation interval)
- Comparing selection strategies (mass selection, progeny testing, genomic selection)

**Key takeaway**: Genomic selection resolves the accuracy vs. generation interval trade-off.

---

### Part 3: Selection Methods

#### **Chapter 7: Estimating Breeding Values**

Learn how to predict genetic merit:

- Simple methods: own performance, pedigree index, progeny average
- Contemporary groups: accounting for environmental differences
- BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) - the modern standard
- Understanding EBVs (Estimated Breeding Values)
- Accuracy and reliability of predictions
- Examples: Dairy Net Merit, Beef EPDs, Swine EBVs

**Key takeaway**: BLUP uses all information optimally to estimate breeding values.

---

#### **Chapter 8: Genetic Correlations and Correlated Response**

Understand how traits are genetically linked:

- Genetic correlation (r_A): correlation between breeding values for two traits
- Causes: pleiotropy (same genes) or linkage (genes on same chromosome)
- Interpreting correlations: positive, negative (antagonistic), zero
- Correlated response to selection
- Important examples:
  - Dairy: milk yield vs. fertility (r_A ≈ -0.35) ❌
  - Swine: growth rate vs. backfat (r_A ≈ +0.30) ❌
  - Beef: weaning weight vs. yearling weight (r_A ≈ +0.70) ✅

**Key takeaway**: Negative genetic correlations require multi-trait selection.

---

#### **Chapter 9: Multiple Trait Selection and Selection Index**

Learn to balance improvement across multiple traits:

- The need for multi-trait selection
- Breeding goal (H) vs. selection index (I)
- Economic weights: how much is each trait worth?
- Selection index theory: b = P⁻¹ G v
- Calculating and interpreting index weights
- Real-world examples: Dairy Net Merit, Beef Terminal Index, Swine Sow Index

**Key takeaway**: Selection indices optimally combine traits based on economic value and genetic parameters.

---

### Part 4: Mating Systems and Crossbreeding

#### **Chapter 10: Mating Strategies and Optimum Contribution Selection**

Learn to make smart mating decisions:

- Selection vs. mating decisions
- Types of mating systems (random, assortative, compensatory)
- Managing inbreeding and genetic diversity
- Inbreeding coefficient (F) and inbreeding depression
- Optimum Contribution Selection (OCS): maximize gain while constraining inbreeding
- Software tools: MateSel, AlphaMate

**Key takeaway**: Mating decisions affect both genetic gain and long-term genetic diversity.

---

#### **Chapter 11: Crossbreeding and Hybrid Vigor**

Exploit heterosis for improved performance:

- What is crossbreeding and why crossbreed?
- Heterosis (hybrid vigor): superior performance of crossbreds
- Genetic basis: dominance, overdominance, epistasis
- Traits with high heterosis: reproductive traits (5-20%)
- Crossbreeding systems: terminal cross, rotational, composite breeds
- Industry structure:
  - **Swine**: (Large White × Landrace) F₁ × Duroc terminal sire
  - **Beef**: Crossbred cows × terminal sire
  - **Poultry**: Proprietary four-way crosses

**Key takeaway**: Crossbreeding is nearly universal in commercial swine and poultry production.

---

### Part 5: Genomic Tools

#### **Chapter 12: Introduction to Genomics**

Learn about DNA markers and genomic technologies:

- What is genomics in animal breeding?
- SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms): the most common genetic markers
- SNP chips (arrays): genotyping thousands to millions of SNPs
- Bioinformatics basics: quality control, imputation
- Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
- Applications: genomic selection, parentage verification, GWAS, inbreeding management

**Key takeaway**: Genomic technologies have revolutionized animal breeding since ~2008.

---

#### **Chapter 13: Genomic Selection**

Understand modern genomic prediction methods:

- What is genomic selection? Predicting breeding values from SNP data
- Why it works: linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and causal mutations
- Genomic BLUP (GBLUP): using genomic relationship matrix (G)
- SNP-BLUP: estimating effects of individual SNPs
- Bayesian methods: BayesA, BayesB, BayesC (allow SNPs to have different effects)
- Single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP): the industry standard
- Impact: doubled rate of genetic gain in dairy cattle

**Key takeaway**: Genomic selection enables high-accuracy predictions for young animals without waiting for progeny.

---

### Part 6: Practical Applications

#### **Chapter 14: Practical Animal Breeding and Data Skills**

Build practical skills for industry careers:

- SQL basics for querying breeding databases
- APIs for accessing genomic data and services
- Data management and quality control
- Animal identification systems (RFID, DNA-based parentage)
- Phenotypic culling vs. genetic selection
- Career paths: geneticist, data manager, reproductive technician, bioinformatician
